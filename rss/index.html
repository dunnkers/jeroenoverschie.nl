We are experiencing peak-hype levels for AI and expectations are sky-high. But still, many companies fail to generate actual value with GenAI. Why is that? Why are we promised so much yet manage to get so little? What is still fantasy and what concrete potential exists? What should be automated and what should not? In this blogpost, we explore the GenAI automation potential that exists today for&#xA0;<em>data extraction</em>.</p><p>Together, we will learn about:</p><ol><li>Why GenAI data extraction</li><li>The automation levels</li><li>The automation potential</li></ol><p>Let&#x2019;s start!</p><h2 id="1-why-genai-data-extraction">1. Why GenAI data extraction</h2><p>Why exactly should we care about GenAI data extraction? Let us motivate this by looking at 4 example usecases in different domains and with various data types like text-, images-, documents- or audio.</p><ul><li>Insurance claims (text)</li><li>Menu cards (images)</li><li>Annual reports (PDF documents)</li><li>Customer service calls (audio)</li></ul><h3 id="insurance-claims-text">Insurance claims (text)</h3><p>Imagine you are running an insurance company and your employees are tasked with processing insurance claims. Claims are often provided in a free-form format: email, phone call, chat, in short: unstructured data. Your employees will then need to process this information to handle the claim: update the internal databases, find similar claim cases, etc. Let&#x2019;s take the case where we receive this information in free-form&#xA0;<strong>text</strong>&#xA0;like emails.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/genai-automation-opportunity-sde-Slide202504041048_Victim_data_extraction_-_entire_email_box.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" title="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction 1" width="1908" height="872"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">LLMs can extract structured data from free-form text like an insurance claim, saving employees time doing it manually.&#xA0;See&#xA0;</span><a href="https://github.com/xebia/genai-data-extraction/blob/main/notebooks/insurance_claims_reports.ipynb" rel="noopener"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Code</span></a><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">.</span></figcaption></figure><p>We instruct the LLM to give its answers in&#xA0;<em>structured</em>&#xA0;format&#xA0;<a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output?lang=python" rel="noopener"><sup>[ref]</sup></a>, so we can easily work with- and transform its output. To clear this entire email box with some 25 emails Gemini 2.0 Flash took some 15 seconds. That is if ran&#xA0;<em>sequentially</em>: if ran in parallel this amount of data process can be processed in a matter of seconds. If this were scaled to process a mailbox of 100k emails we would spend about $1.52. Not an awful lot given we can save some serious time here. We can also half this cost if we use Gemini&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/batch-prediction-gemini" rel="noopener">Batch API</a>&#xA0;instead. How long would it take a human to process 100k emails? What is their time worth?</p><p>Extracting client information from this email message took Gemini 2.0 Flash about 0.5 seconds and cost $0.000015.</p><h3 id="menu-cards-images">Menu cards (images)</h3><p>Different usecase. Imagine now you are running an online platform for food delivery. You want to digitise menu cards so the offering can be ingested in your own platform in standardised manner. You are staffing a number of employees to help you do this task. The menu cards arrive in&#xA0;<strong>image</strong>&#xA0;format. Can we speed up the menu conversion process?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/genai-automation-opportunity-sde-Slide202504041048_Menu_card.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" title="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction 2" width="1893" height="1108"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">LLMs can read menu cards and convert them directly into a desired structured format, cutting development cost for custom- OCR and extraction solutions and potentially providing superior extraction performance.&#xA0;See&#xA0;</span><a href="https://github.com/xebia/genai-data-extraction/blob/main/notebooks/menu_card.ipynb" rel="noopener"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Code</span></a><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Yes: we can speed this up. LLMs consider the image as a whole and are also able to accurately process text details in the image. Because we are using a generic model images in many contexts can be processed by the same model without having to fine-tune over specific situations.</p><p>Converting this menu card took Gemini 2.0 Flash about 10 seconds and cost $0.0005. How long would a human take?</p><h3 id="annual-reports-pdf-documents">Annual reports (PDF documents)</h3><p>Imagine you are tasked with answering questions based on financial documents. You are to go through each question and reason on the answer based on information provided in the documents. Take annual statements, for example. Companies worldwide are obliged to publish these statements and company finances are to be audited. Going through such documents is time-consuming. Take an annual statement in&#xA0;<strong>PDF document</strong>&#xA0;format. Can we help employees formulate answers based on this document faster?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/genai-automation-opportunity-sde-Slide202504041048_Ahold_report.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" title="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction 3" width="1914" height="945"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">An entire annual report document of 382 pages fits in the model context at once, allowing the model to answer questions considering the&#xA0;</span><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">whole</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#xA0;document. Reasoning-type of questions like audit questionnaires can now be answered by LLMs, citing where the answer is located. The human gets a head start and then only has to check and extend the answers, saving time.&#xA0;See&#xA0;</span><a href="https://github.com/xebia/genai-data-extraction/blob/main/notebooks/annual_report_audit.ipynb" rel="noopener"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Code</span></a><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Yes. The document fits in the model context&#xA0;<em>all at once</em>, allowing the model to take a comprehensive view of the document and formulate sensible answers. In fact, LLMs like Google&#x2019;s Gemini models take up to 2 million tokens in context at once&#xA0;<a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/long-context" rel="noopener"><sup>[ref]</sup></a>. This allows for up to 3,000 PDF pages to be inserted into the prompt. PDF pages are processed as images by Gemini&#xA0;<a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/vision?lang=python" rel="noopener"><sup>[ref]</sup></a>.</p><p>Answering these questions took Gemini 2.0 Flash just under 1 minute and cost $0.015 . How long would a human take?</p><h3 id="customer-service-calls-audio">Customer service calls (audio)</h3><p>Imagine you have a customer service department and are processing many calls on the daily. The customer service agents do their best to document and record useful information during the call but cannot possibly document all valuable information. Calls are temporarily recorded for analytical purposes. Calls could be listened back to figure out the customer problem, the root cause, the solution and the customer sentiment. This information is valuable to have because this is necessary feedback information to improve customer service in a targeted way. What issues were we most often unable to resolve? In what situations are our customers left unhappy?</p><p>The insights are valuable, but hard to get to. The data is hidden in an&#xA0;<strong>audio format</strong>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/genai-automation-opportunity-sde-Slide202504041048_Customer_support_call.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" title="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction 4" width="1910" height="1124"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">LLMs can listen to audio quicker than any human. Customer service calls can be analysed and previously-inaccessible but valuable information can be extracted and taken advantage of. Insights can be gathered in automated fashion, effectively improving business processes in targeted fashion.&#xA0;See&#xA0;</span><a href="https://github.com/xebia/genai-data-extraction/blob/main/notebooks/annual_report_audit.ipynb" rel="noopener"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Code</span></a><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini 2.0 Flash processed this 5-minute customer service call in 3 seconds and spent $0.0083. That is faster than any human takes to listen- and process the call. LLMs can also accurately process audio, without the need for a transcription step first. Because the model is exposed to the raw audio file, more than just the words that are spoken can be taken into account. In what&#xA0;<em>way</em>&#xA0;is this customer talking? Is this customer happy or unhappy? Off-the-shelf LLMs can be used without modification and just by prompting to extract structured data from audio&#xA0;<a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/audio?lang=python" rel="noopener"><sup>[ref]</sup></a>.</p><p>Concluding on the 4 usecase examples, we learned the following.</p><ul><li><strong>LLMs for data extraction</strong>: LLMs can be used to extract structured data from free-form formats like text, images, PDFs, and audio.</li><li><strong>Larger contexts</strong>: Growing LLM context windows allow processing of larger documents at once. This strengthens the applicability for data extraction using LLMs without the need for extra retrieval steps.</li><li><strong>Competitive pricing</strong>: Lower inference costs make more data extraction use cases feasible.</li><li><strong>GenAI data extraction ROI</strong>: LLMs can complete data extraction tasks faster than humans and at a lower cost. Albeit not at perfection, the goal is to create a system that is good enough to assist humans in their work and provide business value.</li></ul><p>That is really cool. LLMs are becoming more capable and cheaper, making possible more usecases than before. So now what exactly is this data extraction? How can we use this to our advantage to automate business processes? What are&#xA0;<strong>the automation levels</strong>&#xA0;for data extraction?</p><h2 id="2-the-automation-levels">2. The automation levels</h2><p>To discover what is possible with GenAI data extraction, we will divide into 4 levels of increasing automation.</p><ul><li><strong>Level 0: Manual</strong></li><li><strong>Level 1: Assisted</strong></li><li><strong>Level 2: Autopilot</strong></li><li><strong>Level 3: Autonomous</strong></li></ul><h3 id="level-0-manual-work">Level 0: Manual work</h3><p>No automation is applied. Human labor is required to extract data in the desired format. The extracted data is then consumed by a human user. All of the data extraction-, evaluation of the data quality and any actions to be done with the data are manual human processes.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/genai-automation-opportunity-sde-Slide202504041048_SDE_manual_work.png" class="kg-image" alt="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" title="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction 5" width="1623" height="427"></figure><p>Without automation, manual work is required to extract data in structured format. After extraction humans decide on what to do with the data.</p><p>We can do better. LLMs can be used to automate part of this process, helping the human in the&#xA0;<strong>Assisted</strong>automation level.</p><h3 id="level-1-assisted">Level 1: Assisted</h3><p>In the assisted workflow, a LLM is used to extract useful data. This process we like to call&#xA0;<strong>Structured Data Extraction</strong>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/genai-automation-opportunity-sde-Slide202504041048_SDE_Assisted.png" class="kg-image" alt="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" title="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction 6" width="1643" height="471"></figure><p>LLMs can be used for structured data extraction: extracting useful data from free-form documents in structured format.</p><p>That can already save a lot of time. Previously we needed to manually perform the tedious process of processing the document to formulate answers in the target format. In this level of automation, though, we are still targeting a human user as output. The human user is responsible for all of evaluating the LLM output and deciding what to do with the data. This gives the human control but also costs extra time. We can do better in&#xA0;<strong>Autopilot</strong>.</p><h3 id="level-2-autopilot">Level 2: Autopilot</h3><p>In the autopilot workflow we go a step further. The extracted data is directly ingested in a&#xA0;<strong>Data Warehouse</strong>, opening up new automation possibilities. With the data in the data warehouse the data can be more efficiently taken advantage of. We can now use the data for dashboards and insights as well as use the data for Machine Learning usecases.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/genai-automation-opportunity-sde-Slide202504041048_The_SDE_integration_benefit.png" class="kg-image" alt="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" title="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction 7" width="1913" height="695"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When extracted data is ingested into a Data Warehouse the data can be more efficiently taken advantage of. Dashboards can reveal new insights and ML usecases can benefit from richer available data.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ingesting this data directly into a Data Warehouse can be beneficial indeed. But with the introduction of this automated ingestion we also need to be careful. Data Warehouse consumers are farther away from the extraction process and are not aware of the data quality. We need to always ask ourselves: Is this data reliable?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/genai-automation-opportunity-sde-Slide202504041048_Is_this_data_reliable.png" class="kg-image" alt="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" title="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction 8" width="1418" height="474"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Data Warehouse consumers need to always be aware of data- quality and reliability.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Bad data quality can lead to misleading insights and bad decisions later down. This is not what we want! Quantified metrics informing us on the data reliability are required. Those with expertise in the dataset and those involved in the extraction process will need to help out. These are typically an AI Engineer and a Subject Matter Expert. We need to introduce an&#xA0;<strong>evaluation</strong>&#xA0;step.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/genai-automation-opportunity-sde-Slide202504041048_SDE_Autopilot.png" class="kg-image" alt="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" title="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction 9" width="1913" height="1084"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A Subject Matter Expert is required to label samples of data, informing Data Warehouse consumers and engineers on the data reliability. The Subject Matter Expert is to be enabled to also experiment with the data extraction process, lowering iteration times.</span></figcaption></figure><p>More steps are introduced, keeping the human-in-the-loop. The steps are necessary, though. The Subject Matter Expert plays a key role in ensuring the quality- and reliability of the data. This gives Data Warehouse consumers the trust they are looking for and at the same time enables the AI Engineer to more systematically improve the Structured Data Extraction system. Additionally, enabling the Subject Matter Expert themselves to be part of the prompting process lowers iteration times and reduces context being lost in translation between AI Engineer and Subject Matter Expert. Win-win.</p><p>We can go more automated, even. Let&#x2019;s continue to the last level:&#xA0;<strong>Autonomous</strong>.</p><h3 id="level-3-autonomous">Level 3: Autonomous</h3><p>In this level, the last human interactions are ought to be automated. Evaluation previously manually done by the Subject Matter Expert is now done by&#xA0;<strong>Quality Assurance- and evaluation</strong>&#xA0;tooling.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/genai-automation-opportunity-sde-Slide202504041048_SDE_Autonomous_mode.png" class="kg-image" alt="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" title="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction 10" width="1913" height="1065"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Introducing Quality Assurance- and evaluation tooling allows the Structured Data Extraction system to run fully autonomous.</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what do we mean with such tooling? We want tooling to help us guarantee the outcome and quality of our data without minimal human intervention. This can be&#xA0;<a href="https://github.com/llm-as-a-judge/Awesome-LLM-as-a-judge" rel="noopener">LLM-as-a-judge systems</a>, for example. The required effort, however, to successfully implement such systems and run them safely is high. One gets value in return, from extra automation, but whether this is worth the effort- and cost is the question. Let&#x2019;s compare the automation levels and summarise its potential.</p><h2 id="3-the-automation-potential">3. The automation potential</h2><p>We have learned about each of the four different levels of automation for data extraction using GenAI. Also, for each level, we have explored how architecturally a Structured Data Extraction system would look like. That is great, but now where is most potential? Let&#x2019;s first summarise the automation levels as follows:</p>

<p>So say you are thinking about implementing a data extraction usecase. What is the ultimate goal? The ultimate goal need not always be to automate as much as possible: it should be to create value. Because perhaps, you can benefit largely enough from your usecase if Assisted- or Autopilot automation is applied and the extra investment to full automation is not worth it. If we were to take the menu card example from earlier, how would potential time savings look like?</p><p><strong>Time savings for automating data extraction</strong>&#xA0;(example):&#xA0;<br>30 minutes (manual) &#x2192; 5 minutes (assisted) &#x2192; 1 minute (autopilot) &#x2192; 0 minutes (autonomous).</p><p>We can see that the time savings are not linear. The more automation we apply, the less time we save. Even though, the last step is the hardest and most expensive to implement. It is not always worth the effort and cost to implement this last step. These are the&#xA0;<strong>Diminishing Returns</strong>&#xA0;of automation, which can be plotted as follows:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/genai-automation-opportunity-sde-Slide202504041048_Automation_is_nice_but_value_is_the_goal.png" class="kg-image" alt="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" title="The GenAI automation potential of data extraction 11" width="1730" height="922"></figure><p>Automation is nice but value is the goal.

To conclude, GenAI for data extraction is:</p><ul><li>Useful for a wide variety of usecases with various data types including text, images, PDFs and audio.</li><li>More likely to provide ROI due to 1) cheaper models, 2) larger context windows and 3) more capable models able to process multi-modal data.</li><li>Very well suited for&#xA0;<em>partial automation</em>: which can bring business value without needing extra investment for full automation.</li></ul><p>Good luck with your own GenAI data extraction usecases &#x1F340;&#x2661;.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com ⧉)]]></title><description><![CDATA[LLM’s can be supercharged using a technique called RAG, allowing us to overcome dealbreaker problems like hallucinations or no access to internal data.

RAG is gaining more industry momentum and is becoming rapidly more mature both in the open-source world and at major Cloud vendors. But what can we expect from RAG? What is the current state of the tech in the industry? What use cases work well and which are more challenging? Let&#x2019;s find out together!</p><h2 id="why-rag">Why RAG</h2><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a popular technique to combine retrieval methods like vector search together with Large Language Models (LLM&#x2019;s). This gives us several advantages like retrieving extra information based on a user search query: allowing us to quote and cite LLM-generated answers. In short,&#xA0;<strong>RAG is valuable because</strong>:</p><ul><li>Access to up-to-date knowledge</li><li>Access to internal company data</li><li>More factual answers</li></ul><p>That all sounds great. But how does RAG work? Let&#x2019;s introduce the Levels of RAG to help us understand RAG in increasing grades of complexity.</p><h2 id="the-levels-of-rag">The Levels of RAG</h2><p>RAG has many different facets. To help more easily understand RAG, let&#x2019;s break it down into four levels:</p>

One of the main techniques powering our retrieval step is&#xA0;<strong>Vector Search</strong>.</p><h3 id="vector-search">Vector Search</h3><p>To retrieve documents relevant to our user query, we will use Vector Search. This technique is based on&#xA0;<em>vector embeddings</em>. What are those? Imagine we embed words. Then words that are semantically similar should be closer together in the embedding space. We can do the same for sentences, paragraphs, or even whole documents. Such an embedding is typically represented by vectors of 768-, 1024-, or even 3072 dimensions. Though we as humans cannot visualize such high-dimensional spaces: we can only see 3 dimensions! For example sake let us compress such an embedding space into 2 dimensions so we visualize it:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide2-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="688"></figure><p>Embeddings that are similar in meaning are closer to each other. In practice not in 2D but higher dimensions like 768D.</p><p>Note this is a drastically oversimplified explanation of vector embeddings. Creating vector embeddings of text: from words up to entire documents, is quite a study on its own. Most important to note though is that with embeddings we capture the&#xA0;<em>meaning</em>&#xA0;of the embedded text!</p><p>So how to use this for RAG? Well, instead of embedding words we can embed our source documents instead. We can then&#xA0;<em>also</em>&#xA0;embed the user question and then perform a&#xA0;<em>vector similarity search</em>&#xA0;on those:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide3.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="688"></figure><p>Embedding both our source documents and the search query allows us to do a&#xA0;<em>vector similarity search</em>.</p><p>Great!

To test our RAG system, we need some data. I recently went to PyData and figured how cool would it be to create a RAG based on their schedule.

We can then find sessions similar to the user question using vector similarity search and answer the question based on a predefined prompt. Let&#x2019;s test it out!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide8.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="948"></figure><p>Testing out our basic RAG system.

Upon inspection of the schedule we can see that the listed talks are indeed all related to sports. We just built a first RAG system &#x1F389;.</p><p>There are points of improvement, however. We are now embedding the sessions in its entirety. But embedding large pieces of text can be problematic, because:</p><ul><li>&#x274C; Embeddings can get saturated and lose meaning</li><li>&#x274C; Imprecise citations</li><li>&#x274C; Large context &#x2192; high cost</li></ul><p>So what we can do to solve this problem is to divide up text in smaller pieces, then embed those instead. This is&#xA0;<strong>Chunking</strong>.</p><h3 id="chunking">Chunking</h3><p>In chunking the challenge lies in determining&#xA0;<em>how</em>&#xA0;to divide up the text to then embed those smaller pieces. There are&#xA0;<em>many</em>&#xA0;ways to chunk text. Let&#x2019;s first look at a simple one. We will create chunks of fixed length:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide9.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="633"></figure><p>Splitting a text into fixed-sized pieces does not create meaningful chunks. Words and sentences are split in random places.&#xA0;<br><a href="https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/character/langchain_text_splitters.character.CharacterTextSplitter.html#langchain_text_splitters.character.CharacterTextSplitter">Character Text Splitter</a>&#xA0;with&#xA0;<code>chunk_size = 25</code>. This is an unrealistically small chunk size but is merely used for example sake.</p><p>This is not ideal. Words, sentences and paragraphs are not respected and are split at inconvenient locations. This decreases the quality of our embeddings. We can do better than this. Let&#x2019;s try another splitter that tries to better respect the structure of the text by taking into account line breaks (&#xB6;):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide10.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="633"></figure><p>Text is split, respecting line breaks (&#xB6;). This way, chunks do not span across paragraphs and split better.&#xA0;<br><a href="https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/character/langchain_text_splitters.character.RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.html#langchain_text_splitters.character.RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter">Recursive Character Text Splitter</a>&#xA0;with&#xA0;<code>chunk_size = 25</code>. This is an unrealistically small chunk size but is merely used for example sake.</p><p>This is better. The quality of our embeddings is now better due to better splits. Note that&#xA0;<code>chunk_size = 25</code>&#xA0;is only used for example sake. In practice we will use larger chunk sizes like 100, 500, or 1000. Try and see what works best on your data. But most notably, also do experiment with different text splitters. The&#xA0;<a href="https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/text_splitters_api_reference.html#">LangChain Text Splitters</a>&#xA0;section has many available and the internet is full of others.</p><p>Now we have chunked our text, we can embed those chunks and ingest them in our vector database. Then, when we let the LLM answer our question we can also ask it to state which chunks it used in answering the question. This way, we can pinpoint accurately which information the LLM was grounded in whilst answering the question, allowing us to provide the user with&#xA0;<strong>Citations</strong>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide11.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="1006"></figure><p>Chunks can be used to show user where the information came from to generate the final answer, allowing us to show the user source&#xA0;<strong>citations</strong>.</p><p>That is great. Citations can be very powerful in a RAG application to improve transparency and thereby also user trust. Summarized, chunking has the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Embeddings are more meaningful</li><li>Precise citations</li><li>Shorter context &#x2192; lower cost</li></ul><p>We can now extend our&#xA0;<em>Document retrieval</em>&#xA0;step with chunking:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide12.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="959"></figure><p>RAG retrieval step with&#xA0;<strong>chunking</strong>.</p><p>We have our Basic RAG set up with&#xA0;<em>Vector search</em>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<em>Chunking</em>.

Let&#x2019;s take the question &#x201C;<em>What&#x2019;s the talk starting with Maximizing about?</em>&#x201D; and launch it at our RAG:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide13.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="727"></figure><p>For this question the incorrect context is retrieved, causing the LLM to give a&#xA0;<em>wrong</em>&#xA0;answer.<br>UI shown is&#xA0;<a href="https://www.langchain.com/langsmith">LangSmith</a>, a GenAI monitoring tool. Open source alternative is&#xA0;<a href="https://langfuse.com/">LangFuse</a>.</p><p>Ouch! This answer is wildly wrong. This is not the talk starting with&#xA0;<em>Maximizing</em>. The talk described has the title&#xA0;<em>Scikit-Learn can do THAT?!</em>, which clearly does not start with the word&#xA0;<em>Maximizing</em>.</p><p>For this reason, we need another method of search, like&#xA0;<em>keyword search</em>. Because we would also still like to keep the benefits of vector search, we can combine the two methods to create a&#xA0;<strong>Hybrid Search</strong>.</p><h2 id="level-2-hybrid-search">Level 2: Hybrid Search</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-level-2-high-res.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="562"></figure><p>In Hybrid Search, we aim to combine two ranking methods to get the best of both worlds. We will combine&#xA0;<em>Vector search</em>&#xA0;with&#xA0;<em>Keyword search</em>&#xA0;to create a Hybrid Search setup. To do so, we must pick a suitable ranking method. Common ranking algorithms are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf"><strong>TF-IDF</strong></a>: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25"><strong>Okapi BM-25</strong></a>: Okapi Best Matching 25</li></ul><p>&#x2026; of which we can consider BM-25 an improved version of TF-IDF. Now, how do we combine Vector Search with an algorithm like BM-25? We now have two separate rankings we want to&#xA0;<em>fuse</em>&#xA0;together into one. For this, we can use&#xA0;<strong>Reciprocal Rank Fusion</strong>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide14.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="872"></figure><p>Reciprocal Rank Fusion is used to merge two ranking methods into one (see&#xA0;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rrf.html">Elastic Search docs</a>).</p><p>Reciprocal Rank Fusion is massively useful to combine two rankings. This way, we can now use both Vector search and Keyword search to retrieve documents. We can now extend again our&#xA0;<em>Document retrieval</em>&#xA0;step to create a Hybrid Search setup:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide15.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="959"></figure><p>The RAG retrieval step with&#xA0;<strong>hybrid search</strong>.</p><p>Most notably, when a user performs a search, a query is made both to our vector database and to our keyword search.

It did so by boosting the terms used in the search query. Without the document available in our prompt context, the LLM could impossibly give us the correct answer. Let&#x2019;s see both the retrieval step and generation step to see what our LLM now answers on this question:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide17.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="727"></figure><p>With the correct context, we also got the correct answer!</p><p>That is the correct answer &#x2713;. With the right context available to the LLM we also get the right answer. Retrieving the right context is the most important feature of our RAG: without it, the LLM can impossibly give us the right answer.</p><p>We now learned how to build a Basic RAG system and how to improve it with Hybrid Search. The data we loaded in comes from the PyData Eindhoven 2024 schedule: which was actually conveniently available in JSON format. But what about other data formats? In the real world, we can be asked to ingest other formats into our RAG like HTML, Word, and PDF.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide18.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="656"></figure><p>Having structured data available like JSON is great, but that is not always the case in real life&#x2026;</p><p>Formats like HTML, Word and especially PDF can be very unpredictable in terms of structure, making it hard for us to parse them consistently.

<p>We will now want to first parse those documents into raw text, such that we can then chunk- and embed that text. To do so, we will use a PDF parser for Python like&#xA0;<a href="https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">pypdf</a>.

We embedded and ingested the raw text into our vector database and can now make queries against it. Let&#x2019;s ask about the cost of a Falcon 9 rocket launch:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide22.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="735"></figure><p>Our RAG can now answer questions about the PDF&#x2019;s.</p><p>Awesome, that is the correct answer. Let&#x2019;s try another question: &#x201C;<em>What is the payload I can carry with the Falcon 9 rocket to Mars?</em>&#x201C;:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide23.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="740"></figure><p>Ouch! Our RAG got the answer wrong. It suggests that we can bring 8,300 kg of payload to Mars with a Falcon 9 rocket whilst in reality, this is 4,020 kg. That&#x2019;s no small error.</p><p>Ow! Our RAG got that answer all wrong. It suggests we can bring double the payload to Mars than what is allowed. That is pretty inconvenient, in case you were preparing for a trip to Mars &#x1F609;.</p><p>We need to debug what went wrong. Let&#x2019;s look at the context that was passed to the LLM:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide24.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="834"></figure><p>The context provided to the LLM contains jumbled and unformatted text originating from a table. It should therefore come as no surprise that our LLM has difficulties answering questions about this table.</p><p>That explains a bunch. The context we&#x2019;re passing to the LLM is hard to read and has a table encoded in a jumbled way. Like us the LLM has a hard time making sense of this. Therefore, we need to better encode this information in the prompt so our LLM can understand it.</p><p>If we want to support tables we can introduce an extra processing step. One option is to use Computer vision models to detect tables inside our documents, like&#xA0;<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/table-transformer"><code>table-transformer</code></a>. If a table gets detected we can then give it a special treatment. What we can for example do, is encode tables in our prompt as&#xA0;<strong>Markdown</strong>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide25.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="420"></figure><p>First parsing our table into a native format and then converting it to Markdown allows our LLM to much better understand the table.</p><p>Having detected the table and parsed it into a native format in our Python code allows us to then encode it in Markdown. Let&#x2019;s pass that to our LLM instead and see what it answers this time:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide26.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="849"></figure><p>Our RAG got the answer correct this time.</p><p>Hurray! We got it correct this time. The LLM we used could easily interpret the Markdown table and pinpoint the correct value to use in answering the question. Note that still, we need to be able to retrieve the table in our retrieval step. This setup assumes we built a retrieval step that is able to retrieve the table given the user question.</p><p>However, I have to admit something. The model we have been using for this task was GPT-3.5 turbo, which is a text-only model. Newer models have been released that can handle more than just text, which are&#xA0;<em>Multimodal</em>&#xA0;models. After all, we are dealing with PDF&#x2019;s which can also be seen as a series of images. Can we leverage such multimodal models to better answer our questions? Let&#x2019;s find out in Level 4:&#xA0;<strong>Multimodal</strong>.</p><h2 id="level-4-multimodal">Level 4: Multimodal</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-level-4-high-res.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="562"></figure><p>In this final level, we will look into leveraging the possibilities of Multimodal models. One of them is GPT-4o, which was announced May 2024:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide27.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="531"></figure><p>GPT-4o is a multimodal model that can reason across audio, vision and text. Launched by OpenAI in May 2024.</p><p>This is a very powerful model that can understand audio, vision and text. This means we can feed it images as part of an input prompt. Given that we can in our retrieval step retrieve the right PDF pages to use, we can insert those images in the prompt and ask the LLM our original question. This has the advantage that we can understand content that was previously&#xA0;<em>very</em>&#xA0;challenging to encode in just text. Also, content we interpret and encode as text is exposed to more conversion steps exposing us to risk of information getting lost in translation.</p><p>For example sake we will take the same table we had before but then answer the question using a Multimodal model. We can take the retrieved PDF pages encoded as images and insert them right into the prompt:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide28.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="874"></figure><p>With a Multimodal model, we can insert an image in the prompt and let the LLM answer questions about it.</p><p>Impressive. The LLM got the answer correct. We should be aware though, that inserting images in the prompt comes with a very different token usage than the Markdown table we inserted as text before:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/levels-of-rag-Slide29.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Levels of RAG (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="2112" height="327"></figure><p>When using Multimodal models, do be aware of the extra cost that comes with it.</p><p>That is an immense increase in cost. Multimodal models can be incredibly powerful to interpret content that is otherwise very difficult to encode in text, as long as it is worth the cost &#x2713;.</p><h2 id="concluding">Concluding</h2><p>We have explored RAG in 4 levels of complexity. We went from building our first basic RAG to a RAG that leverages Multimodal models to answer questions based on complex documents. Each level introduces new complexities which are justified in each their own way. Summarising, the Levels of RAG are:</p>

Services like <em>Vertex AI Search &amp; Conversation</em> and <em>Vertex AI Vector Search</em> give us scalability and ease of use. How can you best leverage them to build RAG applications? Let&#x2019;s explore together. Read along!</p><h2 id="retrieval-augmented-generation"><strong>Retrieval Augmented Generation</strong></h2><p>Even though <em>Retrieval-Augmented Generation</em> (<strong>RAG</strong>) was coined already in 2020, the technique got supercharged since the rise of <em>Large Language Models</em> (<strong>LLMs</strong>). With RAG, LLMs are combined with search techniques like vector search to enable realtime and efficient lookup of information that is outside the model&#x2019;s knowledge. This opens up many exciting new possibilities. Whereas previously interactions with LLMs were limited to the model&#x2019;s knowledge, with RAG it is now possible to load in company internal data like knowledge bases. Additionally, by instructing the LLM to always &#x2018;ground&#x2019; its answer based on factual data, hallucinations can be reduced.</p><h3 id="why-rag"><strong>Why RAG?</strong></h3><p>Let&#x2019;s first take a step back. How exactly can RAG benefit us? When we interact with an LLM, all its factual knowledge is stored inside the model weights. The model weights are set during its training phase, which can be a while ago. In fact, this can be more than a year.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table class="fancy-table" style="box-sizing: border-box; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; border-color: inherit; --tw-border-spacing-x: 0;

Whereas the document retrieval is responsible for finding the most relevant information given the user&#x2019;s question, the answer generation is responsible for generating a human-readable answer based on information found in the retrieval step. Let&#x2019;s take a look at both in more detail.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/rag-on-gcp-Slide3.png.webp" class="kg-image" alt="RAG on GCP: production-ready GenAI on Google Cloud Platform (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The two main steps in a RAG system: Document retrieval and Answer generation.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="document-retrieval"><strong>Document retrieval</strong></h3><p>First, <strong>Document retrieval</strong>. Documents are converted to plain text and <a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/">chunked</a>. The chunks are then embedded and stored in a vector database. User questions are also embedded, enabling a <em>vector similarity search</em> to obtain the best matching documents. Optionally, a step can be added to extract document metadata like title, author, summary, keywords, etc, which can subsequently be used to perform a <em>keyword</em> search. This can all be illustrated like so:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/rag-on-gcp-Slide4.jpg.webp" class="kg-image" alt="RAG on GCP: production-ready GenAI on Google Cloud Platform (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Document retrieval step in a RAG system.

We will need an LLM for this and instruct it to use the provided documents. We can illustrate this like so:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/rag-on-gcp-Slide6.png.webp" class="kg-image" alt="RAG on GCP: production-ready GenAI on Google Cloud Platform (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Answer generation step using Gemini, with an example prompt.

So now, what other offerings does GCP have to help us build a RAG system and what flavours are there to combine services?</p><h2 id="the-rag-flavours-on-gcp"><strong>The RAG flavours on GCP</strong></h2><p>So far, we have seen GCP services that can help us build a RAG system. These include <em>Document AI</em>, <em>Vertex AI Vector Search</em>, <em>Gemini Pro</em>, <em>Cloud Storage</em> and <em>Cloud Run</em>. But GCP also has Vertex AI Search &amp; Conversation.</p><p><strong>Vertex AI Search &amp; Conversation</strong> is a service tailored to GenAI usecases, built to do some of the heavy lifting for us. It can ingest documents, create embeddings and manage the vector database. You just have to focus on ingesting data in the correct format. Then, you can use Search &amp; Conversation in multiple ways. You can either get only <em>search results</em>, given a search query, or you can let Search &amp; Conversation generate a full answer for you with source citations.</p><p>Even though Vertex AI Search &amp; Conversation is very powerful, there can be scenarios when you want more control. Let&#x2019;s take a look on these levels of going either <em>managed</em> or remaining in-control.</p><p>The easiest way to get started with RAG on GCP is to use <strong>Search &amp; Conversation</strong>. The service can ingest documents from multiple sources like <em>Big Query</em> and <em>Google Cloud Storage</em>. Once those are ingested, it can generate answers backed by citations for you. This is simply illustrated like so:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/rag-on-gcp-Slide7.png.webp" class="kg-image" alt="RAG on GCP: production-ready GenAI on Google Cloud Platform (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Fully managed RAG using Search &amp; Conversation for document retrieval and answer generation.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want more control, you can use <strong>Gemini</strong> for answer generation instead of letting Search &amp; Conversation do it for us. This way, you can have more control to do any prompt engineering you like.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/rag-on-gcp-Slide8.png.webp" class="kg-image" alt="RAG on GCP: production-ready GenAI on Google Cloud Platform (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Partly managed RAG using Search &amp; Conversation for document retrieval and Gemini for answer generation.</figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, you can have full control over the RAG system. This means you have to manage both the document retrieval and answer generation yourself. This does mean more manual work in engineering the system. Documents can be processed by <em>Document AI</em>, chunked, embedded and its vectors stored in <em>Vertex AI Vector Search</em>. Then <em>Gemini</em> can be used to generate the final answers.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/rag-on-gcp-Slide9.png.webp" class="kg-image" alt="RAG on GCP: production-ready GenAI on Google Cloud Platform (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Full control RAG. Manual document processing, embedding creation and vector database management.</figcaption></figure><p>The advantage here is that you are able to fully control yourself <em>how</em> you process the documents an convert them to embeddings. You can use all of Document AI&#x2019;s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/processors-list">Processors offering</a> to process the documents in different ways.</p><p>Do take the the managed versus manual approach tradeoffs into consideration. Ask yourself questions like:</p><ul><li>How much time and energy do you want to invest building something custom for the flexibility that you need?</li><li>Do you really need the flexibility for your solution to give in to extra maintenance cost?</li><li>Do you have the engineering capacity to build- and maintain a custom solution?</li><li>Are the initially invested build costs worth the money saved in not using a managed solution?</li></ul><p>So then, you can decide what works best for you &#x2713;.</p><h2 id="concluding"><strong>Concluding</strong></h2><p>RAG is a powerful way to augment LLMs with external data. This can help reduce hallucinations and provide more factual answers. At the core of RAG systems are document processors, vector databases and LLM&#x2019;s.</p><p>Google Cloud Platform offers services that can help build production-ready RAG solutions. We have described three levels of control in deploying a RAG application on GCP:</p><ul><li><strong>Fully managed</strong>: using Search &amp; Conversation.</li><li><strong>Partly managed</strong>: managed search using Search &amp; Conversation but manual prompt-engineering using Gemini.</li><li><strong>Full control</strong>: manual document processing using Document AI, embedding creation and vector database management using Vertex AI Vector Search.</li></ul><p>That said, I wish you good luck implementing your own RAG system.

This allows newcomers to easily understand the different parts of your CI/CD setup using DevOps pipelines.</li></ul><h3 id="2-passing-data-between-templates"><strong><strong>2. Passing data between templates</strong></strong></h3><p>Let&#x2019;s go a step further and also abstract away the build and release steps into templates. We are going to use the following template for <strong>building a Python wheel</strong>:</p><pre><code class="language-yaml">steps:
# Build wheel

    echo $(Build.BuildNumber) &gt; version.txt

- publish: &apos;$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/dist&apos;
  artifact: wheelFiles
  displayName: &apos;Upload wheel as artifact&apos;
</code></pre><p>This definition is slightly different than the one we defined before, in the initial pipeline. This pipeline uses <strong><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/artifacts/pipeline-artifacts?view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=yaml">artifacts</a></strong>. These allow us to <em>pass</em> data between jobs or stages. This is useful when we want to split up our pipeline into smaller pieces. Splitting up the process into smaller segments gives us more visibility and control over the process. Another benefit of this, is that when we split the Python wheel build and release process, is that we give ourselves the ability to <em>release to multiple providers at once</em>.</p><p>When this pipeline is ran we can see an artifact (a wheel file) has been added:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2024/04/scaling-up-your-azure-devops-ci-cd-setup-build-artifact-example.png.webp" class="kg-image" alt="Scaling up: bringing your Azure DevOps CI/CD setup to the next level &#x1F680; (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="506" height="480"></figure><p>&#x2026; with the actual wheel file in there:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2024/04/scaling-up-your-azure-devops-ci-cd-setup-build-artifact-example-wheel-file.png.webp" class="kg-image" alt="Scaling up: bringing your Azure DevOps CI/CD setup to the next level &#x1F680; (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="1756" height="668" srcset="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/scaling-up-your-azure-devops-ci-cd-setup-build-artifact-example-wheel-file.png.webp 600w, https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/scaling-up-your-azure-devops-ci-cd-setup-build-artifact-example-wheel-file.png.webp 1000w, https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/size/w1600/2024/04/scaling-up-your-azure-devops-ci-cd-setup-build-artifact-example-wheel-file.png.webp 1600w, https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2024/04/scaling-up-your-azure-devops-ci-cd-setup-build-artifact-example-wheel-file.png.webp 1756w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>This is also useful so we can inspect what the build pipeline has produced. We can now <em>download</em> this wheel file from the artifacts again. We will do this in the publish pipeline.</p><p><strong>template/publish-wheel.yml</strong></p><pre><code class="language-yaml">parameters:

</code></pre><p>And here we have another new feature coming in. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/stages?view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=yaml">Stages</a>. These allow us to execute pipelines that depend on each other. We have now split up our pipeline into 2 stages:</p><ol><li>Build stage</li><li>Publish stage</li></ol><p>Using stages makes it easy to see what is going on. It provides transparency and allows you to easily track the progress of the pipeline. You can also launch stages separately, skipping previous stages, as long as the necessary dependencies are in place. For example, dependencies can include artifacts, which were generated in previous stage.</p><h4 id="improving-the-release-process"><strong><strong>Improving the release process</strong></strong></h4><p>So what is another advantage of this setup? Say that you are releasing your package to <strong>two pip registries</strong>. Doing that is easy using this setup by creating two jobs in the publish stage:</p><pre><code class="language-yaml">- stage: Publish
  jobs:
  - job: PublishToRegistryOne
    steps:
    - script: |
        pip install twine==4.0.2
      displayName: &apos;Install twine&apos;

    - template: templates/publish-wheel.yml
      parameters:
        artifactFeed: &apos;better-devops-pipelines-blogpost/registry-1&apos;

  - job: PublishToRegistryTwo
    steps:
    - script: |
        pip install twine==4.0.2
      displayName: &apos;Install twine&apos;

    - template: templates/publish-wheel.yml
      parameters:
        artifactFeed: &apos;better-devops-pipelines-blogpost/registry-2&apos;
        repositoryName: &apos;devops-pipelines-blogpost&apos;
</code></pre><p>As you can see, we can use the defined templates to scale our pipelines. What is essential here, is that thanks to using the artifacts, we can build our wheel <em>once</em> and consume that same wheel <em>multiple</em> times.</p><p>Additionally, the publishing jobs launch <strong>in parallel</strong> by default (unless dependencies are explicitly defined). This speeds up your release process.</p><h3 id="3-automate-using-a-strategy-matrix"><strong><strong>3. Automate using a strategy matrix</strong></strong></h3><p>Let&#x2019;s go back to the code quality stage for a minute. In the code quality stage, we are first installing a certain Python version, and then running all quality checks. However, we might need guarantees that our code works for multiple Python versions. This is often the case when releasing a package, for example. How can we easily automate running our Code Quality pipeline using our pipeline <em>templates</em>? One option is to manually define a couple jobs and install the correct python version in each job. Another option is to use a <strong><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema/jobs-job-strategy?view=azure-pipelines">strategy matrix</a></strong>. This allows us to define a matrix of variables that we can use in our pipeline.</p><p>We can improve our <code>CodeQualityChecks</code> job like so:</p><pre><code class="language-yaml">jobs:
- job: CodeQualityChecks
  strategy:
    matrix:
      Python38:
        python.version: &apos;3.8&apos;
      Python39:
        python.version: &apos;3.9&apos;
      Python310:
        python.version: &apos;3.10&apos;
      Python311:
        python.version: &apos;3.11&apos;

  steps:
  - task: UsePythonVersion@0
    inputs:
      versionSpec: $(python.version)

  - script: |
      pip install .[dev]
    displayName: &apos;Install dependencies&apos;

  - template: templates/code-quality.yml
</code></pre><p>Awesome! The pipeline now runs the entire code quality pipeline for each Python version. Looking at how our pipeline runs now, we can see multiple jobs, one for each Python version:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2024/04/scaling-up-your-azure-devops-ci-cd-setup-strategy-matrix-example.png.webp" class="kg-image" alt="Scaling up: bringing your Azure DevOps CI/CD setup to the next level &#x1F680; (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="1574" height="866" srcset="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/scaling-up-your-azure-devops-ci-cd-setup-strategy-matrix-example.png.webp 600w, https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/scaling-up-your-azure-devops-ci-cd-setup-strategy-matrix-example.png.webp 1000w, https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2024/04/scaling-up-your-azure-devops-ci-cd-setup-strategy-matrix-example.png.webp 1574w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>.. as you can see 4 jobs are launched.

The codebase is built on a specific Python version, using a certain Java installation, and an accompanying pyspark version that works with the former. To onboard a new member, you will need to pass a list of instructions the developer needs to follow carefully to get their setup working. But not everyone might run this on the same laptop environment: different hardware, and different operating systems. This is getting challenging.<br>But the setup is a one-off, right? Just go through the setup once and you&#x2019;ll be good. Not entirely. Your code environment will change over time: your team will probably install-, update- or remove packages during the project&#x2019;s development. This means that if a developer creates a new feature and changes their own environment to do so; he or she also needs to make sure that the other team members change theirs and that the production environment is updated accordingly. This makes it easy to get misaligned environments: between developers, and between development &amp; production.</p><p>We can do better than this! Instead of giving other developers a setup document, let&#x2019;s make sure we also create formal instructions so we can <em>automatically</em> set up the development environment. <em>Devcontainers</em> let us do exactly this.</p><p><strong>Devcontainers</strong> let you connect your IDE to a running Docker container. In this way, we get the benefits of reproducibility and isolation, whilst getting a native development experience.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/devcontainer-overview-4.png.webp" class="kg-image" alt="How to create a Devcontainer for your Python project &#x1F433; (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy"><figcaption>With Devcontainers you can interact with your IDE like you&apos;re used to whilst under the hood running everything inside a Docker container.</figcaption></figure><p></p><p>Devcontainers can help us:</p><ul><li>Get a reproducible development environment</li><li>&#x26A1;&#xFE0F; Instantly onboard new team members onto your project</li><li>&#x200D; &#x200D; &#x200D; Better align the environments between team members</li><li>&#x23F1; Keeping your dev environment up-to-date &amp; reproducible saves your team time going into production later</li></ul><p>Let&#x2019;s explore how we can set up a Devcontainer for your Python project!</p><h2 id="creating-your-first-devcontainer"><strong>Creating your first Devcontainer</strong></h2><p>Note that this tutorial is focused on <strong>VSCode</strong>. Other IDE&#x2019;s like PyCharm support running in Docker containers but support is less comprehensive than on VSCode.</p><h3 id="recap"><strong>Recap</strong></h3><p>To recap, we are trying to create a dev environment that installs: 1) Java, 2) Python and 3) pyspark. And we want to do so <em>automatically</em>, that is, inside a Docker image.</p><h3 id="project-structure"><strong>Project structure</strong></h3><p>Let&#x2019;s say we have a really simple project that looks like this:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">$ tree .
.
&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; README.md
&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; requirements.txt
&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; requirements-dev.txt
&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; sales_analysis.py
&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500; test_sales_analysis.py</code></pre><p>That is, we have a Python module with an accompanying test, a <code>requirements.txt</code> file describing our production dependencies (pyspark), and a <code>requirements-dev.txt</code> describing dependencies that should be installed in development only (pytest, black, mypy). Now let&#x2019;s see how we can extend this setup to include a Devcontainer.</p><h3 id="the-devcontainer-folder"><strong>The <code>.devcontainer</code> folder</strong></h3><p>Your Devcontainer spec will live inside the <code>.devcontainer</code> folder. There will be two main files:</p><ul><li><code>devcontainer.json</code></li><li><code>Dockerfile</code></li></ul><p>Create a new file called <code>devcontainer.json</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;build&quot;: {
        &quot;dockerfile&quot;: &quot;Dockerfile&quot;,
        &quot;context&quot;: &quot;..&quot;
    }
}</code></pre><p>This means: as a base for our Devcontainer, use the <code>Dockerfile</code> located in the current directory, and build it with a <em>current working directory</em> (cwd) of <code>..</code>.</p><p>So what does this <code>Dockerfile</code> look like?</p><pre><code class="language-docker">FROM python:3.10

# Install Java
RUN apt update &amp;&amp; 
    apt install -y sudo &amp;&amp; 
    sudo apt install default-jdk -y

## Pip dependencies
# Upgrade pip
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
# Install production dependencies
COPY requirements.txt /tmp/requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r /tmp/requirements.txt &amp;&amp; 
    rm /tmp/requirements.txt
# Install development dependencies
COPY requirements-dev.txt /tmp/requirements-dev.txt
RUN pip install -r /tmp/requirements-dev.txt &amp;&amp; 
    rm /tmp/requirements-dev.txt</code></pre><p>We are building our image on top of <code>python:3.10</code>, which is a Debian-based image. This is one of the Linux distributions that a Devcontainer can be built on. The main requirement is that <strong>Node.js</strong> should be able to run: VSCode automatically installs VSCode Server on the machine. For an extensive list of supported distributions, see <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/linux">&#x201C;Remote Development with Linux&#x201D;</a>.</p><p>On top of <code>python:3.10</code>, we install Java and the required pip packages.</p><h3 id="opening-the-devcontainer"><strong>Opening the Devcontainer</strong></h3><p>The <code>.devcontainer</code> folder is in place, so it&#x2019;s now time to open our Devcontainer.</p><p>First, make sure you have the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers">Dev Containers extension</a> installed in VSCode (previously called &#x201C;Remote &#x2013; Containers&#x201D;. That done, if you open your repo again, the extension should already detect your Devcontainer:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/folder-contains-a-dev-container-config-file.png.webp" class="kg-image" alt="How to create a Devcontainer for your Python project &#x1F433; (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Alternatively, you can open up the command palette (CMD + Shift + P) and select &#x201C;<em>Dev Containers: Reopen in Container</em>&#x201D;:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/reopen-in-devcontainer-notification.png.webp" class="kg-image" alt="How to create a Devcontainer for your Python project &#x1F433; (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Your VSCode is now connected to the Docker container :</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/opening-the-devcontainer.gif.webp" class="kg-image" alt="How to create a Devcontainer for your Python project &#x1F433; (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy"></figure><h3 id="what-is-happening-under-the-hood"><strong>What is happening under the hood</strong></h3><p>Besides starting the Docker image and attaching the terminal to it, VSCode is doing a couple more things:</p><ol><li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/vscode-server"><strong>VSCode Server</strong></a> is being installed on your Devcontainer. VSCode Server is installed as a service in the container itself so your VSCode installation can communicate with the container. For example, install and run extensions.</li><li><strong>Config is copied</strong> over. Config like <code>~/.gitconfig</code> and <code>~/.ssh/known_hosts</code> are copied over to their respective locations in the container.<br>This then allows you to use your Git repo like you do normally, without re-authenticating.</li><li><strong>Filesystem mounts</strong>. VSCode automatically takes care of mounting: 1) The folder you are running the Devcontainer from and 2) your VSCode workspace folder.</li></ol><h3 id="opening-your-repo-directly-in-a-devcontainer"><strong>Opening your repo directly in a Devcontainer</strong></h3><p>Since all instructions on how to configure your dev environment are now defined in a Dockerfile, users can open up your Devcontainer with just one button:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/v1.svg" class="kg-image" alt="How to create a Devcontainer for your Python project &#x1F433; (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Ain&#x2019;t that cool? You can add a button to your repo like so:</p><pre><code>[
    ![Open in Remote - Containers](
        https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/v1.svg    )
](
    https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/godatadriven/python-devcontainer-template
)</code></pre><p>Just modify the GitHub URL &#x2713;.</p><p>That said, we can see having built a Devcontainer can make our README massively more readable.

        &quot;vscode&quot;: {

However, the defined settings provide just a <strong>default</strong> for the user to use, and can still be overridden by other setting scopes like User Settings, Remote Settings, or Workspace Settings.</p><h3 id="accessing-spark-ui"><strong>Accessing Spark UI</strong></h3><p>Since we are using pyspark, we want to be able to access <strong>Spark UI</strong>. When we start a Spark session, VSCode will ask whether you want to forward the specific port. Since we already know this is Spark UI, we can do so automatically:</p><pre><code class="language-json">    &quot;portsAttributes&quot;: {
        &quot;4040&quot;: {

Indeed, we can do this with Devcontainers. Similarly to how the Devcontainer image is built locally using <code>docker build</code>, the same can be done <em>within</em> a CI/CD pipeline. There are two basic options:</p><ol><li>Build the Docker image <em>within</em> the CI/CD pipeline</li><li>Prebuilding the image</li></ol><p>To pre-build the image, the build step will need to run either periodically or whenever the Docker definition has changed. Since this adds quite some complexity let&#x2019;s dive into building the Devcontainer as part of the CI/CD pipeline first (for pre-building the image, see the &#x2018;Awesome resources&#x2019; section). We will do so using <strong>GitHub Actions</strong>.</p><h4 id="using-devcontainersci"><strong>Using <code>devcontainers/ci</code></strong></h4><p>Luckily, a GitHub Action was already set up for us to do exactly this:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/devcontainers/ci">https://github.com/devcontainers/ci</a></p><p>To now build, push and run a command in the Devcontainer is as easy as:</p><pre><code class="language-yaml">name: Python app

For local development and running our quality checks. And, once we deploy this application to production, we could configure the Devcontainer to use our production image as a base, and install extra dependencies on top. If we want to optimize the CI image to be as lightweight as possible, we could also strip off any extra dependencies that we do not require in the CI environment; things as extra CLI tooling, a better shell such as ZSH, and so forth.</p><p>This sets us up for having 3 different images for our entire lifecycle. One for Development, one for CI, and finally one for production. This can be visualized like so:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/three-environments.png.webp" class="kg-image" alt="How to create a Devcontainer for your Python project &#x1F433; (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy"></figure><p>So, we can see, when using a Devcontainer you can re-use your production image and build on top of it.

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>First, let&apos;s boot up a local spark session:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()

<p>Say we have this dataset containing some persons:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from pyspark.sql import Row

people = spark.createDataFrame(
    [
        Row(age=12, name=&quot;Damian&quot;),
        Row(age=15, name=&quot;Jake&quot;),
        Row(age=18, name=&quot;Dominic&quot;),
        Row(age=20, name=&quot;John&quot;),
        Row(age=27, name=&quot;Jerry&quot;),

people
</code></pre>
<p>Okay, that&apos;s great. Now, what we would like to do, is map each person&apos;s age to an age category.</p>

<p>Cool! We just put our ages in buckets, represented by numbers. Let&apos;s now map each bucket to a life phase.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from pyspark.sql.functions import lit, create_map
from typing import Dict
from pyspark.sql.column import Column

range_mapper = create_map(
    [lit(0.0), lit(&quot;Not yet born&quot;)]
    + [lit(1.0), lit(&quot;Child&quot;)]
    + [lit(2.0), lit(&quot;Teenager&quot;)]
    + [lit(3.0), lit(&quot;Young adulthood&quot;)]
    + [lit(4.0), lit(&quot;Adult&quot;)]
    + [lit(5.0), lit(&quot;Elderly&quot;)]
)
people_phase_column: Column = bucketed[&quot;life phase&quot;]
people_with_phase: DataFrame = bucketed.withColumn(
    &quot;life phase&quot;, range_mapper[people_phase_column]

people_with_phase.show()

<p>&#x1F389; Success!</p>
<p>Using a combination of <code>Bucketizer</code> and <code>create_map</code>, we managed to map people&apos;s age to their life phases.</p>
<h2 id="pyspark-bucketmap"><code>pyspark-bucketmap</code></h2>
<p>&#x1F381; As a bonus, I put all of the above in a neat little module, which you can install simply using <code>pip</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">%pip install pyspark-bucketmap
</code></pre>
<p>Define the splits and mappings like before. Each dictionary key is a mapping to the n-th bucket (for example, bucket 1 refers to the range <code>0</code> to <code>12</code>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import List

splits: List[float] = [-float(&quot;inf&quot;), 0, 12, 18, 25, 70, float(&quot;inf&quot;)]
mapping: Dict[int, Column] = {
    0: lit(&quot;Not yet born&quot;),
    1: lit(&quot;Child&quot;),
    2: lit(&quot;Teenager&quot;),
    3: lit(&quot;Young adulthood&quot;),
    4: lit(&quot;Adult&quot;),
    5: lit(&quot;Elderly&quot;),
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then, simply import <code>pyspark_bucketmap.BucketMap</code> and call <code>transform()</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from pyspark_bucketmap import BucketMap
from typing import List, Dict

bucket_mapper = BucketMap(
    splits=splits, mapping=mapping, inputCol=&quot;age&quot;, outputCol=&quot;phase&quot;
)
phases_actual: DataFrame = bucket_mapper.transform(people).select(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;phase&quot;)
phases_actual.show()

It&#x2019;s easy to visualize, because it&#x2019;s 2D, and (therefore) easy to get started with. Still, a 100 x 100 field with 1500 blocks allows for enough freedom to play this game in more ways than there are atoms in the universe!</p><h3 id="behind-the-screens"><strong>Behind the screens</strong></h3><p>Participants could, and anyone still can, submit their solutions on the <a href="https://dropblox.azurewebsites.net/submit" rel="noopener">submission page</a>, as well as see the leaderboard with submissions of all other participants. To make this possible, several things happened behind the screens, which are worth noting here.</p><p>Most importantly, we worked with a team of excited people with complementing skill sets. Together we created the framework that is visualized in Fig. 4.</p><p>We have a separate private repository, in which we keep all the logic that is hidden to the participant. In there, we have the ground-truth scoring function, and all logic necessary to run our web app. When participants submit their solution or check out the leaderboard, an Azure Function spins up to run the logic of our web app. The Azure Function is connected to an SQL database, where we store or retrieve submissions from. &#xA0;We store images, such as the visualization of the final solution, in the blob storage. To create the leaderboard, we retrieve the top-scoring submissions of each user and combine them with the corresponding images in the blob storage.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/components.png.webp" class="kg-image" alt="DropBlox: Coding Challenge at PyCon DE &amp; PyData Berlin 2022 (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="600" height="237"><figcaption>Figure 4: The different components of the challenge, including those hidden to the participants.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="creating-hype"><strong>Creating hype</strong></h3><p>What&#x2019;s the use of a competition if nobody knows about it?

We put our prize right in front, and a real-time dashboard showing the highscores beside. Surely, anyone walking past will at least question themselves what that Lego toy is doing at a Python conference.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/booth_gdd.png.webp" class="kg-image" alt="DropBlox: Coding Challenge at PyCon DE &amp; PyData Berlin 2022 (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="500" height="331"><figcaption>Figure 5: Our company booth at PyCon DE &amp; PyData Berlin 2022</figcaption></figure><p>Second, we went out to the conference Lightning Talks and announced our competition there. Really, the audience was great. Gotta love the energy at conferences like these.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2022-07-27-at-14.56.10.png.webp" class="kg-image" alt="DropBlox: Coding Challenge at PyCon DE &amp; PyData Berlin 2022 (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="500" height="284"><figcaption>Figure 6: Promoting the challenge at a Lightning Talk</figcaption></figure><p>With our promotion set up, competitors started trickling in. Let the games begin!</p><h3 id="strategies"><strong>Strategies</strong></h3><p>Strategies varied from near brute-force approaches to the use of convolutional kernels and clever heuristics. In the following, we discuss some interesting and top-scoring submissions of participants.</p><h4 id="14"><strong>#14</strong></h4><p>S. Tsch&#xF6;ke named his first approach &#x201C;Breakfast cereal&#x201D;, as he was inspired by smaller cereal pieces collecting at the bottom and larger ones in the top of a cereal bag. Pieces were dropped from left to right, smaller ones before larger ones, until none could fit anymore. This approach, resulting in around 25k points, was however not successful enough.</p><p>After a less successful, but brave approach using a genetic algorithm, he extended the breakfast cereal approach. This time, instead of the size of a block he used the block&#x2019;s density, or the percentage of filled tiles within the height and width of a block; and he sorted the blocks by color. Taking a similar approach as before, but now including the different color orderings, resulted in 46k points. (See Fig. 6)</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/number-14.png" class="kg-image" alt="DropBlox: Coding Challenge at PyCon DE &amp; PyData Berlin 2022 (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="450" height="450"><figcaption>Figure 6: Final solution of the #14 in the challenge, S. Tsch&#xF6;ke, with 45844 points.</figcaption></figure><h4 id="2"><strong>#2</strong></h4><p>We jump up a few places to R. Garnier, who was #1 up until the last moments of the challenge. He went along with a small group of dedicated participants who started exploiting the row multipliers. Unexpectedly, this led to an interesting and exciting development in the competition.</p><p>His strategy consisted of two parts. The first is to manually construct some rows of the same color of the same height. This way, he created 3 full orange rows, one red and one purple. Subsequently, he uses a greedy algorithm, following the steps:</p><ol><li>Assign a score to each block: score = (block values) / (block surface)</li><li>Sort the blocks by score</li><li>For each block, drop the block where it falls down the furthest&#x200B;&#x200B;</li></ol><p>This strategy resulted in 62k points. (See Fig. 7)</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/number-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="DropBlox: Coding Challenge at PyCon DE &amp; PyData Berlin 2022 (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="450" height="450"><figcaption>Figure 7: Final solution of the #2 in the challenge, R. Garnier, with 62032 points.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="1"><strong>#1</strong></h3><p>With a single last-minute submission, G. Chanturia answered the question to &#x201C;How far can we go?&#x201D;. He carefully constructed pairs of blocks that fit together, to manually engineer the bottom half of his solution, taking the row multipliers to the next level.</p><p>G. is doing a PhD in Physics and a MSc in Computer Science, and fittingly splits his solution into a &#x201C;physicist&#x2019;s solution&#x201D; and a &#x201C;programmer&#x2019;s solution&#x201D;.</p><p>The physicist&#x2019;s solution refers to the bottom part of the field. The strategy used here, as summarized by G., was (1) taking a look at the blocks, and (2) placing them in a smart way. Whether you are a theoretical or experimental physicist, data serves as a starting point. G. noticed there is an order in the blocks. First of all, a lot of orange blocks had their top and bottom rows filled. Placing these in a clever way already results in six completely filled rows.<br>Second, there were &#x201C;W&#x201D; and &#x201C;M&#x201D;-shaped blocks that fit perfectly together. He kept going on like this to manually construct the bottom 1/3 of the field, accounting for 57% of the total score.</p><p>The programmer&#x2019;s solution refers to the rest of the field. The problem with the first approach is that it is not scalable. Even more, if the blocks would change he would have to start all over. This second approach is more robust, and is similar to R. Garnier&#x2019;s approach. The steps are:</p><ol><li>Filter blocks based on their height. Blocks above height = 5 are filtered out, because many of these blocks have too weird shapes to work with.</li><li>Sort the blocks by points (or similarly, by color). Blocks with higher scoring colors are listed first.</li><li>Pick the first n available blocks in the sorted list. The larger n, the better the solution, but the longer it takes to run. The chosen number was around 50.</li><li>Find out which block can fall the furthest down in the field</li><li>Drop that block and remove it from the list</li><li>Repeat from 3</li></ol><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/number-one.png" class="kg-image" alt="DropBlox: Coding Challenge at PyCon DE &amp; PyData Berlin 2022 (on Xebia.com &#x29C9;)" loading="lazy" width="450" height="450"><figcaption>Figure 8: Final solution of the #1 in the challenge, G.

We created a framework to host a high score leaderboard, process submissions and display the puzzles online. To sum up the process in a few words:</p><ul><li>Hosting a coding challenge at a conference is fun!</li><li>Gather participants by promoting the challenge</li><li>Hand over the prize to the winner</li></ul><p>It was interesting to see what strategies our participants came up with, and how the high score constantly improved even though this seemed unlikely at some point. We learned that starting off with a simple heuristic and expanding upon that is a good way to get your algorithm to solve a problem quickly. However, to win in our case, a hybrid solution involving a bit of manual engineering was needed to outperform all strategies relying solely on generalizing algorithms.</p><p>Quite likely, we will be re-using the framework we built to host some more code challenges.

However, we do not always require the full complexity of a Neural Network: sometimes, a simpler model will do the job just fine. In this project, we take a journey starting from the most fundamental statistical machinery to model data distributions, linear regression, to then explain the benefits of constructing more complex models, such as logistic regression or a Neural Network. In this way, this text aims to build a bridge from the statistical, analytical world to the more approximative world of Machine Learning. We will not shy away from the math, whilst still working with tangible examples at all times: we will work with real-world datasets and we will get to apply our models as we go on. Let&apos;s start!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2>Linear Regression <small style="color:#ccc;">(<a style="color:#ccc;" href="https://dunnkers.com/linear-regression-to-neural-networks/linear-regression.html">Code</a>)</small></h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>First, we will explore linear regression, for it is an easy to understand model upon which we can build more sophisticated concepts. We will use a <a href="https://github.com/allisonhorst/penguins">dataset</a> on Antarctican penguins (Gorman et al., 2014) to conduct a regression between the penguin <em>flipper length</em> as independent variable $X$ and the penguin <em>body mass</em> as the dependent variable $Y$. We can analytically solve Linear Regression by minimizing the <em>Residual Sum-of-Squares</em> cost function (Hastie et al., 2009):</p><p>$$\text{R}(\beta) = (Y - X \beta)^T (Y - X \beta)$$</p><p>In which $X$ is our <em>design matrix.</em> Regression using this loss function is also referred to as &quot;Ordinary Least Squares&quot;. The mean of the cost function $\text{R}$ over all samples is called Mean Squared Error, or MSE. Our design matrix is built by appending each data row with a bias constant of 1 - an alternative would be to first center our data to get rid of the intercept entirely. To now minimize our cost function we differentiate $\text{R}$ with respect to $\beta$, giving us the following unique minimum:</p><p>$$\hat{\beta} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y$$</p><p>... which results in the estimated least-squares coefficients given the training data, also called the <em>normal equation</em>. We can classify by simply multiplying our input data with the found coefficient matrix: $\hat{Y} = X \hat{\beta}$. Let&apos;s observe our fitted regression line onto the data:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/linear-regression-flipper-vs-bodymass.svg" class="kg-image" alt="From Linear Regression to Neural Networks" loading="lazy" width="527" height="388"><figcaption>Linear Regression fit on Penguin data using the normal equation. Using a validation data split of &#xBC; testing data and &#xBE; training data.</figcaption></figure><p>We can observe visually that our estimator explains both the training and testing data reasonably well: the line positioned itself along the mean of the data. This is in fact the proposition we make in least-squares - we assume the target to be Gaussian distributed; which in the case of modeling this natural phenomenon, penguins, seems to fit quite well.</p><p>Because at the moment we are very curious, we would also like to explore using a more flexible model. Note that our normal equation we defined above tries to find whatever parameters make the system of linear equations produce the best predictions on our target variable. This means, that hypothetically, we could add any linear combination of explanatory variables we like: such create estimators of a higher-order polynomial form. This is called <strong>polynomial regression</strong>. To illustrate, a design matrix for one explanatory variable $X_1$ would look as follows:</p><p>$$X= \left[\begin{array}{ccccc}1 &amp; x_{1} &amp; x_{1}^{2} &amp; \ldots &amp; x_{1}^{d} \\ 1 &amp; x_{2} &amp; x_{2}^{2} &amp; \ldots &amp; x_{2}^{d} \\ 1 &amp; x_{3} &amp; x_{3}^{2} &amp; \ldots &amp; x_{3}^{d} \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ 1 &amp; x_{n} &amp; x_{n}^{2} &amp; \ldots &amp; x_{n}^{d}\end{array}\right]$$</p><p>Which results in $d$-th degree polynomial regression. The case $d=1$ is just normal linear regression. For example sake, let us sample only $n=10$ samples from our training dataset, and try to fit those with a polynomial regressors of increasing degrees. Let us observe what happens to the training and testing loss accordingly:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/polynomial-degrees.svg" class="kg-image" alt="From Linear Regression to Neural Networks" loading="lazy" width="576" height="384"><figcaption>Polynomial fits of various degrees on just $n=10$ training dataset samples. Testing dataset remained unchanged.</figcaption></figure><p>It can be observed that although for some degrees the losses remain almost the same, we suffer from overfitting after the degree passes $d=30$. We can also visually show how the polynomials of varying degrees fit our data:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/polynomial-fit.gif" class="kg-image" alt="From Linear Regression to Neural Networks" loading="lazy" width="432" height="288"></figure><p>We can indeed observe that the polynomials of higher degree definitely do not better explain our data. Also, the polynomials tend to get rather erratic beyond the last data points of the training data - which is important to consider whenever predicting outside the training data value ranges. Generally, polynomials of exceedingly high degree can overfit too easily and should only be considered in very special cases.</p><p>Up till now our experiments have been relatively simple - we used only one explanatory and one response variable. Let us now explore an example in which we use all available explanatory variables to predict body mass, to see whether we can achieve an even better fit. Because we are now at risk of suffering from <em>multicolinearity</em>; the situation where multiple explanatory variables are highly linearly related to each other, we will use an extension of linear regression which can deal with such a situation. The technique is called <strong>Ridge Regression</strong>.</p><h3 id="ridge-regression">Ridge Regression</h3><p>In Ridge Regression, we aim to tamper the least squares tendency to get as &apos;flexible&apos; as possible to fit the data best it can. This might, however, cause parameters to get very large. We therefore like to add a penalty on the regression parameters $\beta$; we penalise the loss function with a square of the parameter vector $\beta$ scaled by new hyperparameter $\lambda$. This is called a <em>shrinkage method</em>, or also: <strong>regularization.</strong> This causes the squared loss function to become:</p><p>$$\text{R}(\beta) = (Y - X \beta)^T (Y - X \beta)+\lambda \beta^T \beta$$</p><p>This is called regularization with an $L^2$ norm; which generalization is called Tikhonov regularization, which allows for the case where not every parameter scalar is regularized equally. If we were to use an $L^1$ norm instead, we would speak of LASSO regression. If we were to now derive the solutions of $\beta$ given this new cost function by differentiation w.r.t. $\beta$:</p><p>$$\hat{\beta}^{\text {ridge }}=\left(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X}+\lambda \mathbf{I}\right)^{-1} \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{Y}$$</p><p>In which $\lambda$ will be a scaling constant that controls the amount of regularization that is applied. Note $\mathbf{I}$ is the $p\times p$ identity matrix - in which $p$ are the amount of data dimensions used. An important intuition to be known about Ridge Regression, is that directions in the column space of $X$ with small variance will be shrinked the most; this behavior can be easily shown be deconstructing the least-squares fitted vector using a Singular Value Decomposition. That said, let us see whether we can benefit from this new technique in our experiment.</p><p>In the next experiment, we will now use <strong>all</strong> available quantitative variables to try and predict the Penguin body mass. The Penguin- bill length, bill depth and flipper length will be used as independent variables. Note, however, they might be somewhat correlated: see <a href="https://dunnkers.com/linear-regression-to-neural-networks/images/penguin-pairplot.svg">this pairplot</a> on the Penguin data for details. This poses an interesting challenge for our regression. Let us combine this with varying dataset sample sizes and varying settings of $\lambda$ to see the effects on our loss.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/ridge-vs-loss.svg" class="kg-image" alt="From Linear Regression to Neural Networks" loading="lazy" width="768" height="384"></figure><p>Ridge Regression using all quantitative variables in the Penguin dataset to predict body mass. Varying subset sizes of the dataset $n$ as well as different regularization strengths $\lambda$ are shown.</p><p>It can be observed, that using including all quantitative variables did improve the loss on predicting the Penguin body mass using Ridge Regression. In fact, the penalty imposed probably pulled the hyperplane angle down such that the error in fact increased. Ridge Regression is a very powerful technique, nonetheless, and most importantly introduced us to the concept of regularization. In the next chapters on Logistic Regression in Neural Networks, we assume all our models to use $L^2$ regularization.</p><p>Now, the data we fit up until now had only a small dimensionality - this is perhaps a drastic oversimplification in comparison to the real world. How does the analytic way of solving linear regression using the normal equation fare with <strong>higher-dimensional data</strong>?</p><h3 id="high-dimensional-data">High-dimensional data</h3><p>In the real world, datasets might be of very high dimensionality: think of images, speech, or a biomedical dataset storing DNA sequences. These datasets cause different computational strain on the equations to be solved to fit a linear regression model: so let us <strong>simulate</strong> such a high-dimensional situation.</p><p>In our simulation the amount of dimensions will configured to outmatch the amount of dataset samples ($p \gg n$), which extra dimensions we will create by simply adding some noise columns to the design matrix $X$. The noise will be drawn from a Gaussian distribution $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. We can now run an experiment by fitting our linear regression model to the higher-dimensional noised dataset, benchmarking the fitting times of the algorithm.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/Analytic_lower-vs-higher-dimensional.svg" class="kg-image" alt="From Linear Regression to Neural Networks" loading="lazy" width="225" height="142"><figcaption>Linear Regression fitting times for lower- and higher- dimensional Penguin data.</figcaption></figure><p>We can observe that the normal equation takes <strong>a lot</strong> longer to compute for higher-dimensional data. In fact, numerically computing the matrix inverse is very computationally expensive, i.e. computing $(X^TX)^{-1}$. Luckily, there are computationally cheaper techniques to do a regression in higher-dimensional spaces. One such technique is an iterative procedure, called <strong>Gradient Descent</strong>.</p><h3 id="gradient-descent">Gradient Descent</h3><p>Instead of trying to analytically solve the system of linear equations at once, we can choose an iterative procedure instead, such as Gradient Descent. It works by computing the gradient of the cost function with respect to the model weights - such that we can then move in the opposite direction of the gradient in parameter space. Given some loss function $R(\beta)$ and $R_i(\beta)$, which computes the empirical loss for entire dataset and for the $i$-th observation, respectively, we can define one gradient descent step as:</p><p>$$\begin{aligned} \beta^{(r + 1)} &amp;= \beta^{(r)} - \gamma \nabla_{\beta^{(r)}} R(\beta^{(r)}) \\ &amp;= \beta^{(r)} - \gamma \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\partial R_i(\beta^{(r)})}{\partial \beta^{(r)}}\\ \end{aligned}$$</p><p>In which $\gamma$ is the learning rate and $r$ indicates some iteration - given some initial parameters $\beta^0$ and $N$ training samples. Using this equation, we are able to reduce the loss in every iteration, until we converge. Convergence occurs when every element of the gradient is zero - or very close to it. Although gradient descent is used in this vanilla form, two modifications are common: (1) <strong>subsampling</strong> and &#xA0;using a (2) <strong>learning rate schedule</strong>.</p><ol><li>Although in a scenario in which our loss function landscape is convex the vanilla variant does converge toward the global optimum relatively easily, this might not be the case for non-convex error landscapes. We are at risk of getting stuck in local extremes. In this case, it is desirable to introduce some randomness &#x2014; allowing us to jump out local extrema. We can introduce randomness by instead of computing the gradient over the entire sample set, we can do so for a random sample of the dataset called a <em>minibatch</em> (Goodfellow et al., 2014). A side effect is a lighter computational burden per iteration; sometimes causing faster convergence. Because the introduced randomness makes the procedure stochastic instead of deterministic, we call this algorithm <em>Stochastic</em> Gradient Descent, or simply <strong>SGD</strong>.</li><li>Accommodating SGD is often a learning rate schedule: making the learning rate parameter $\gamma$ dependent on the iteration number $r$ such that $\gamma = \gamma^{(r)}$. In this way, we made the learning rate adaptive over time, allowing us to create a custom learning rate scheme. Many schemes (Dogo et al., 2018) exist - which can be used to avoid spending a long time on flat areas in the error landscape called plateaus, or to avoid &apos;overshooting&apos; the optimal solution. Even, a technique analogous with <em>momentum</em> (Qian, 1999) in physics might be used: a particle traveling through space is &apos;accelerated&apos; by the loss gradient, causing the gradient to change faster if it keeps going in the same direction.</li></ol><p>So, let&apos;s now redefine our gradient descent formula to accommodate for these modifications:</p><p>$$\beta^{(r+1)}=\beta^{(r)}-\gamma^{(r)} \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{\partial R_i(\beta^{(r)})}{\partial \beta^{(r)}} $$</p><p>... where we, before each iteration, randomly shuffle our training dataset such that we draw $m$ random samples each step. The variable $m$ denotes the <em>batch size</em> - which can be anywhere between 1 and the amount of dataset samples minus one $N - 1$. The smaller the batch size, the more stochastic the procedure will get.</p><p>Using gradient descent for our linear regression is straight-forward. We differentiate the cost function with respect to the weights; the least squares derivative is then as follows:</p><p>$$\begin{aligned} \frac{\partial R_i(\beta^{(r)})}{\partial \beta^{(r)}} &amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta^{(r)}} (y_i - x_i \beta^{(r)})^2\\ &amp;= 2 (y_i - x_i \beta^{(r)})\\ \end{aligned}$$</p><p>We then run the algorithm in a loop, to iteratively get closer to the optimum parameter values.</p><p>Now, using this newly introduced iterative optimization procedure, let&apos;s see whether we can solve linear regression faster. First, we will compare SGD and the analytic method for our Penguin dataset with standard Gaussian noise dimensions added such that $p=2000$.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/SVGvsAnalytic_p2000.svg" class="kg-image" alt="From Linear Regression to Neural Networks" loading="lazy" width="948" height="460"><figcaption>Fitting time and MSE loss differences of Linear Regression solved using SGD and analytically using the normal equation. 10 experiments are shown; each one is a dot. SGD uses $\gamma^0=0.001$ with an inverse scaling schedule of $\gamma^{r+1} = \frac{\gamma^0}{t^{0.25}}$ and 20 thousand iterations maximum.</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed - our iterative procedure is faster for such a high-dimensional dataset. Because the analytic method always finds the optimum value, it is most plausible that SGD does not achieve the same performance - as can be seen in the MSE loss in the figure. Only in a couple of runs does SGD achieve near-optimum performance - in the other cases the algorithm was either stopped by its maximum iterations limit or it got stuck in some local extrema and has not gotten out yet. If we wanted to get better results, we could have used a more lenient maximum amount of iterations or a stricter convergence condition. This is a clear trade-off between computational workload and the optimality of the solution. We can run some more experiments for various levels of augmented dimensions:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/SVGvsAnalytic_many_p.svg" class="kg-image" alt="From Linear Regression to Neural Networks" loading="lazy" width="957" height="442"><figcaption>Fitting time and MSE loss for several degrees of dataset dimensionality. For each dimensionality, the average and its 95% confidence intervals over 10 experiments are shown. Loss plot is the average of the training and testing set.</figcaption></figure><p>In which we can empirically show that for our experiment, the analytic computation time grows about exponentially whilst SGD causes only a mild increase in computational time. SGD does suffer a higher loss due to its approximative nature - but this might just be worth the trade-off.</p><p>Now that we have gotten familiar with Gradient Descent, we can explore a realm of techniques that rely on being solved iteratively. Instead of doing regression, we will now try to <strong>classify</strong> penguins by their species type &#x2014; a method for doing so is <strong>Logistic Regression</strong>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2>Logistic Regression <small style="color:#ccc;">(<a style="color:#ccc;" href="https://dunnkers.com/linear-regression-to-neural-networks/logistic-regression.html">Code</a>)</small></h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In general, linear regression is no good for classification. There is no notion incorporated into the objective function to desire a hyperplane that best separates two classes. Even if we would encode qualitative target variables in a quantitative way, i.e. in zeros or ones, a normal equation fit would result in predicted values outside the target range.</p><p>Therefore, we require a different scheme. In Logistic Regression, we first want to make sure all estimations remain in $[0,1]$. This can be done using the <strong>Sigmoid function</strong>:</p><p>$$S(z)=\frac{e^z}{e^z+1}=\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$$</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/Logistic-curve.svg" class="kg-image" alt="From Linear Regression to Neural Networks" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400"><figcaption>Sigmoid function $S(z)$. Given any number $z \in \mathbb{R}$ the function always returns a number in $[0, 1]$. Image: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function#/media/File:Logistic-curve.svg">source</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Also called the <em>Logistic function.</em> So, the goal is to predict some class $G \in \{1,\dots,K\}$ given inputs $X$. We assume an intercept constant of 1 to be embedded in $X$. Now let us take a closer look at the case where $K=2$, i.e. the binary or <strong>binomial</strong> case.</p><p>If we were to encode our class targets $Y$ as either ones or zeros, i.e. $Y \in \{0,1\}$, we can predict values using $X \beta$ and pull them through a sigmoid $S(X\beta)$ to obtain the probabilities whether samples belongs to the class encoded as 1. This can be written as:</p><p>$$\begin{aligned} \Pr(G=2|X;\beta)&amp;=S(X\beta)\\ &amp;=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-X\beta)}\\ &amp;=p(X;\beta) \end{aligned}$$</p><p>Because we consider only two classes, we can compute one probability and infer the other one, like so:</p><p>$$\begin{aligned} \Pr(G=1|X;\beta)&amp;=1-p(X;\beta) \end{aligned}$$</p><p>For which it can be easily seen that both probabilities form a <em>probability vector</em>, i.e. their values sum to 1. Note we can consider the targets as a sequence of <em>Bernoulli trials</em> $y_i,\dots,y_N$ - each outcome a binary - assuming all observations are independent of one another. This allows us to write:</p><p>$$\begin{aligned} \Pr (y| X;\beta)&amp;=p(X;\beta)^y(1-p(X;\beta))^{(1-y)}\\ \end{aligned}$$</p><p>So, how to approximate $\beta$? Like in linear regression, we can optimize a loss function to obtain an estimator $\hat{\beta}$. We can express the loss function as a likelihood using <em>Maximum Likelihood Estimation</em>. First, we express our objective into a conditional <strong>likelihood</strong> function.</p><p>$$\begin{aligned} L(\beta)&amp;=\Pr (Y| X;\beta)\\ &amp;=\prod_{i=1}^N \Pr (y_i|X=x_i;\beta)\\ &amp;=\prod_{i=1}^N p(x_i;\beta)^{y_i}(1-p(x_i;\beta))^{(1-y_i)} \end{aligned}$$</p><p>The likelihood becomes easier to maximize in practice if we rewrite the product to a sum using a logarithm; such scaling does not change the resulting parameters. We obtain the <strong>log-likelihood</strong> (Bischop, 2006):</p><p>$$\begin{aligned} \ell(\beta)&amp;=\log L(\beta)\\ &amp;=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left\{y_{i} \log p\left(x_{i} ; \beta\right)+\left(1-y_{i}\right) \log \left(1-p\left(x_{i} ; \beta\right)\right)\right\}\\ &amp;=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left\{y_{i} \beta^{T} x_{i}-\log \left(1+e^{\beta^{T} x_{i}}\right)\right\} \end{aligned}$$</p><p>Also called the <strong><em>logistic loss</em></strong>; which multi-dimensional counterpart is the <em>cross-entropy</em> loss. We can maximize this likelihood function by computing its gradient:</p><p>$$\frac{\partial \ell(\beta)}{\partial \beta}=\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}\left(y_{i}-p\left(x_{i} ; \beta\right)\right)$$</p><p>...resulting in $p+1$ equations nonlinear in $\beta$. The equation is <em>transcendental</em>: meaning no closed-form solution exists and hence we cannot simply solve for zero. It is possible, however, to use numerical approximations: Newton-Raphson method based strategies can be used, such as Newton Conjugate-Gradient, or quasi-Newton procedures might be used such as L-BFGS (Zhu et al., 1997). Different strategies have varying benefits based on the problem type, e.g. the amount of samples $n$ or dimensions $p$. Since the gradient can be approximated just fine, we can also simply use Gradient Descent, i.e. SGD.</p><p>In the case where more response variables are to be predicted, i.e. $K&gt;2$, a <strong>multinomial</strong> variant of Logistic Regression can be used. For easier implementation, some software implementations just perform multiple binomial logistic regressions in order to conduct a multinomial one; which is called a One-versus-All strategy. The resulting probabilities are then normalized to still output a probability vector (Pedregosa et al., 2001).</p><p>That theory out of the way, let&apos;s fit a Logistic Regression model to our penguin data! We will try to classify whether a penguin is a Chinstrap yes or no, in other words: we will perform a binomial logistic regression. We will perform 30K iterations, each iteration an epoch over the training data:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/logistic-metrics.svg" class="kg-image" alt="From Linear Regression to Neural Networks" loading="lazy" width="960" height="336"><figcaption>Logistic Regression model fit on a binary penguin classification task. The model converged at 88.2% training-, 89.7% testing accuracy and a loss of 0.304 on the training set.</figcaption></figure><p>We can observe that the model converged to a stable state already after about 10K epochs - we could have implemented an early stopping rule; for example by checking whether validation scores stop improving or when our loss is no longer changing much. We can also visualize our model fit over time: by predicting over a grid of values at every time step during training. This yields the following animation:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/logistic-fit.gif" class="kg-image" alt="From Linear Regression to Neural Networks" loading="lazy" width="432" height="288"><figcaption>Logistic Regression model fit using SGD with constant learning rate of $\gamma=0.001$ and $L^2$ regularization using $\alpha=0.0005$.</figcaption></figure><p>Clearly, our decision boundary is not optimal yet - whilst the data is somewhat Gaussian distributed our model linearly separates the data. We can do better &#x2014; we need some way to introduce more non-linearity into our model. A model that does just so is a <strong>Neural Network</strong>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2>Neural Network <small style="color:#ccc;">(<a style="color:#ccc;" href="https://dunnkers.com/linear-regression-to-neural-networks/neural-network.html">Code</a>)</small></h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>At last, we arrive at the Neural Network. Using the previously learned concepts, we are really not that far off from assembling a Neural Network. Really, a single-layer Neural Network essentially just a linear model, like before. The difference is, that we conduct some extra projections in order to make the data better linearly separable. In a Neural Network, we aim to find the parameters facilitating such projections automatically. We call each such projection a <em>Hidden Layer</em>. After having conducted a suitable projection, &#xA0;we can pull the projected data through a logistic function to estimate a probability - similarly to logistic regression. One such architecture is like so:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/nn.svg" class="kg-image" alt="From Linear Regression to Neural Networks" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Neural Network architecture for 2-dimensional inputs and a 1-dimensional output with $l=3$ hidden layers each containing 5 neurons (image generated using <a href="http://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/">NN-SVG</a>).</figcaption></figure><p>So, given one input vector $x_i$, we can compute its estimated value by feeding its values through the network from left to right, in each layer multiplying with its parameter vector. We call this type of network <em>feed-forward</em>. Networks that do not feed forward include <em>recurrent</em> or <em>recursive</em> networks, though we will only concern ourselves with feed-forward networks for now.</p><p>An essential component of any such network is an <strong><em>activation function</em>;</strong> a <em>non-linear</em> differentiable function mapping $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, aimed to overcome model linearity constraints. We apply the activation function to every hidden node; we compute the total input, add a bias, and then activate. This process is somewhat analogous to what happens in neurons in the brain - hence the name Neural Network. Among many possible activation functions (Nwankpa et al., 2018), a popular choice is the Rectified Linear Unit, or <strong>ReLU</strong>: $\sigma(z)=\max\{0, z\}$. It looks as follows:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/relu.svg" class="kg-image" alt="From Linear Regression to Neural Networks" loading="lazy" width="480" height="384"><figcaption>ReLU activation function $\sigma(z)=\max \{0,z\}$. The function is easily seen to be piecewise-linear.</figcaption></figure><p>Also because ReLU is just a max operation, it is fast to compute (e.g. compared to a sigmoid). Using our activation function, we can define a <em>forward-pass</em> through our network, as follows:</p><p>$$\begin{aligned} h^{(1)}&amp;=\sigma(X W^{(1)} + b^{(1)})\\ h^{(2)}&amp;=\sigma(h^{(1)} W^{(2)} + b^{(2)})\\ h^{(3)}&amp;=\sigma(h^{(2)} W^{(3)} + b^{(3)})\\ \hat{Y}&amp;=S(h^{(3)}W^{(4)}+b^{(4)}) \end{aligned}$$</p><p>In which $h$ resembles the intermediate projections indexed by its hidden layer; and the parameters $\beta$ mapping every two layers together are accessible through $W$. A bias vector is accessible through $b$, such to add a bias term to every node in the layer. Finally, we apply a Sigmoid to the results of the last layer to receive probability estimates; in the case of multi-class outputs its multi-dimensional counterpart is used, the <em>Softmax</em>, which normalizes the logistic function such to produce a probability vector. Do note that the activation function <em>could</em> differ per layer; and in practice, this might happen. In our case, we will just use one activation function for all hidden layers in our network.</p><p>We are also going to have to define a <strong>cost function</strong>, such to be able to optimize the parameters based on its gradient. We can do so using the minimizing the negative log-likelihood using Maximum Likelihood, given some loss function such as:</p><p>$$ R(\theta)=-\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}\sim\hat{p}_{\text{data }}}\log p_{\operatorname{model}}(\boldsymbol{y}\mid\boldsymbol{x}) $$</p><p>In which we combined weights $W$ and biases $b$ into a single parameter term $\theta$. Our cost function says to quantify the chance of encountering a target $y$ given an input vector $x$. Suitable loss functions to be used are log-loss/cross-entropy, or simply squared error:</p><p>$$ R(\theta)=\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}\sim\hat{p}_{\text{data }}}\|\boldsymbol{y}-f(\boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})\|^{2}+ \text{const} $$</p><p>Assuming $p_{\text{model}}(y|x)$ to be Gaussian distributed. Of course, in any implementation we can only approach the expected value by averaging over a discrete set of observations; thus allowing us to compute the loss of our network.</p><p>Now that we are able to do a forward pass by (1) making predictions given a set of parameters $\theta$ and (2) computing its loss using a cost function $R(\theta)$, we will have to figure out how to actually <strong>train</strong> our network. Because our computation involves quite some operations by now, computing the gradient of the cost function is not trivial - to approximate the full gradient one would have to compute partial derivatives with respect to every weight separately. Luckily, we can exploit the calculus chain rule to break up the problem into smaller pieces: allowing us to much more efficiently re-use previously computed answers. The algorithm using this trick is called <strong>back-propagation</strong>.</p><p>In back-propagation, we re-visit the network in reverse order; i.e. starting at the output layer and working our way back to the input layer. We then use the calculus derivative chain rule (Goodfellow et al., 2014):</p><p>$$\begin{aligned} \frac{\partial z}{\partial x_{i}}&amp;=\sum_{j} \frac{\partial z}{\partial y_{j}} \frac{\partial y_{j}}{\partial x_{i}}\\ &amp;\text{in vector notation:}\\ \nabla_{\boldsymbol{x}} z&amp;=\left(\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{y}}{\partial \boldsymbol{x}}\right)^{\top} \nabla_{\boldsymbol{y}} z \end{aligned}$$</p><p>...to compute the gradient in modular fashion. Note we need to consider the network in its entirety when computing the partial derivatives; the output activation, the loss function, node activations and the biases. To systematically apply back-prop to a network often these functions are abstracted as being an <em>operation</em> - which can then be assembled in a <em>computational graph</em>. Given a suitable such graph, many generic back-prop implementations can be used.</p><p>Once we have now computed the derivative of the cost function $R(\theta)$, our situation became similar to when we iteratively solved linear- or logistic regression: we can now use just Gradient Descent to move in the error landscape.</p><p>Now that we know how to train a Neural Network, let&apos;s apply it! We aim to get better accuracy for our Penguin classification problem than using our Logistic Regression model.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/neural-metrics.svg" class="kg-image" alt="From Linear Regression to Neural Networks" loading="lazy" width="960" height="336"><figcaption>Neural Network fit on a binary penguin classification task.

Intuitively, the decision region looks to have been approximated fairly well - it might just have been slightly &apos;stretched&apos; out.</p><h3 id="ending-note">Ending note</h3><p>Now that we have been able to fit a more &apos;complicated&apos; data distribution, we conclude our journey from simple statistical models such a linear regression up to Neural Networks. Having a diverse set of statistical and iterative techniques in your tool belt is essential for any Machine Learning practitioner: even though immensely powerful models are available and widespread today, sometimes a simpler model will do just fine.</p><p>In tandem with how the bias/variance dilemma is fundamental to understanding how to construct good distribution learning models, one should always take into account not to overreach on model complexity given a learning task (Occam&apos;s Razor; Rasmussen et al., 2001): use an as simple as possible model, wherever possible.</p><h2 id="citations">Citations</h2><ul><li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090081">Gorman KB, Williams TD, Fraser WR (2014).

Applications for GAN&#x2019;s are numerous, including image up-sampling, image generation, and the recently quite popular <strong>Deep Fakes</strong>. In this project, we aim to train such a Generative Adversarial Network ourselves, with the purpose of image generation, specifically. As the generation of human faces has been widely studied, we have chosen a different topic, namely: the generation of paintings. While large datasets of paintings are available, we have opted to restrict ourselves to one artist, as we believe this will give a better chance at producing realistic paintings. For this, we have chosen the Dutch artist <em>Vincent van Gogh</em>, who is known for his unique style.</p><h2 id="how">How</h2><p>There are many GAN architectures around. Some popular of which the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434">DCGAN</a> and the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948">StyleGAN</a>. We decided to train both and compare the results.</p><ul><li>DCGAN. A GAN architecture that has been around for a while. Was trained using <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>.</li><li>StyleGAN. A popular GAN architecture for generating faces, provisioned by NVIDIA Research. Also trained using TensorFlow.</li></ul><p>Both were trained on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ipythonx/van-gogh-paintings">Van Gogh dataset</a>, as available on Kaggle. Because the dataset contained only a limited amount of paintings (painting is, of course, a very time consuming activity), we decided to augment the dataset. Among others, we applied rotation- and shearing operations, and modified the brightness, such that we get more training data.</p><p>The StyleGAN showed the most promising results. Starting out with a seed previously used to generate a face, we managed to train a GAN that produced something that remotely resembled art. Given that a computer is doing this, that&apos;s pretty neat!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/11/retrain_morphing.png" class="kg-image" alt="Making Art with Generative Adversarial Networks" loading="lazy" width="1621" height="540" srcset="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/retrain_morphing.png 600w, https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/retrain_morphing.png 1000w, https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/size/w1600/2021/11/retrain_morphing.png 1600w, https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/11/retrain_morphing.png 1621w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Progressively grown StyleGAN.

Hours, maybe even days. Therefore many Machine Learning practitioners train use public clouds to use powerful GPU&apos;s to speed up the work. Even, to save time, off-the-shelf pre-trained models can be used and then retrained for a specific task &#x2013; this is <em>transfer learning</em>. But using either approach means putting trust in someone else&apos;s hands. Can we be sure the cloud does not mess with our model? Are we sure the off-the-shelf pre-trained model is not malicious? In this article, we explore <em>how</em> an attacker could mess with your model, by means of inserting <em>backdoors</em>.</p><h2 id="inserting-a-backdoor">Inserting a backdoor</h2><p>The idea of a backdoor is to have the Neural Network output a wrong answer <strong>only</strong> when a <em>trigger</em> is present. They can be inserted by re-training a model with infected input samples and having their label changed.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-22-at-10.52.55.png" class="kg-image" alt="Backdoors in Neural Networks" loading="lazy" width="1322" height="476" srcset="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-22-at-10.52.55.png 600w, https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-22-at-10.52.55.png 1000w, https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-22-at-10.52.55.png 1322w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Backdoor <em>triggers</em>. Triggers can be single-pixel or a pattern. (Gu et al. 2017)</figcaption></figure><p>This makes a backdoor particularly hard to spot. Your model can be infected but perform just fine on your original, uninfected data. Predictions are completely off, though, when the trigger is present. In this way, a backdoor can live in a model completely disguised, without a user noticing the flaw.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-22-at-11.41.40.png" class="kg-image" alt="Backdoors in Neural Networks" loading="lazy" width="724" height="548" srcset="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-22-at-11.41.40.png 600w, https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-22-at-11.41.40.png 724w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A stop sign with a trigger (a yellow sticker &#x1F7E8;) applied. The NN mistakes it for a speed limit sign. That&apos;s dangerous! (Gu et al. 2017)</figcaption></figure><p>Besides inconvenience, infected networks might actually be dangerous. Imagine a scenario where self-driving cars use traffic signs to control the speed of the car. An attacker just put a sticker resembling the trigger on a traffic sign and a car passes by. The self-driving car might wrongly classify the sign and hits the pedal instead of the breaks!</p><h2 id="a-latent-backdoor">A latent backdoor</h2><p>This backdoor, however, will not survive the transfer-learning process. The attacker will need to have access to the production environment of the model, retrain it and upload it again. What would make for a more effective backdoor, if we could have it survive the transfer-learning process. This is exactly what a <em>Latent backdoor</em> aims to do.</p><p>A latent backdoor has two components the <em>teacher</em> model and the <em>student</em> model.</p><ul><li><strong>&#x1F608; Teacher model</strong>. The attacker creates and trains a <em>teacher</em> model. Then, some samples get a trigger inserted, and have their labels changed. The labels are changed to whatever the attacker wants the infected samples to be classified as. For example, the attacker might add a label for a speed limit sign.<br>Then, after the training process, the attacker removes the neuron related to classifying the infected label in the Fully Connected layer &#x2013; thus removing any trace of the backdoor.</li><li><strong>&#x1F63F; Student model</strong>. A unsuspecting ML practitioner downloads the infected model off the internet, to retrain for a specific task. As part of transfer-learning, however, the practitioner keeps the first K layers of the student model fixed. In other words: its weights are not changed. Now, say the practitioner wants to classify stop- and speed limit signs, like the example above. Note that now, <em>the classification target that was removed before is added again</em>! But this time, by the unsuspecting practitioner itself.<br>Now, with a trigger in place, the model completely misclassifies stop signs for speed limits. Bad business.</li></ul><p>Triggers in the Latent Backdoor are not just simple pixel configurations. Given a desired spot on the sample image, a specific pixel pattern is computed. Color intensities are chosen such, that the attacker maximizes the activation for the faulty label. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-22-at-12.32.37.png" class="kg-image" alt="Backdoors in Neural Networks" loading="lazy" width="1436" height="550" srcset="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-22-at-12.32.37.png 600w, https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-22-at-12.32.37.png 1000w, https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-22-at-12.32.37.png 1436w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Infecting a sample in a Latent Backdoor.

At the time this project started, the Corona virus was still just a headline for most - but in the meantime it reached and impacted all of our lives. Fighting such a pandemic happens in many ways on multiple scales. We are interested in how this can be done on the societal level: using data. In this project, me and my teammates built a pipeline capable of processing a large dataset and created a visualization of the areas most vulnerable to Corona which includes reported cases in real-time.</p><h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3><p>To quickly summarize the application: a backend downloads- and processes <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">Corona data</a> and <a href="https://www.worldpop.org/">population data</a>. A clustering algorithm is applied to determine the most &apos;vulnerable&apos; areas to Corona outbreak. Then, all resulting insights are stored in a MongoDB database and exposes through an API. A frontend then integrates with Mapbox to show the data visually, on a map. Because we were working with large amounts of data, some sophisticated technologies were required to properly process the data:</p><ul><li>Apache Kafka</li><li>Apache Spark</li><li>Apache Zeppelin to author PySpark scripts</li></ul><p>Brought together, this can be put in a diagram as follows:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/Architecture_Batch.svg" class="kg-image" alt="COVID-19 Dashboard" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The Corona dashboard <b>batch</b> processing architecture.</figcaption></figure><p>All components are hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). To also demonstrate merging both batch- and stream data in a single dashboard, also another architecture was built. This time, we took in tweets that are concerned about Corona through the keyword &apos;Corona&apos; and used a Map-Reduce technique to compute the total amount of Corona-tweets sent by each country in the world. This was then again, stored in a MongoDB database and exposed as an API. See the stream processing architecture below:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/12/Architecture_Streaming.svg" class="kg-image" alt="COVID-19 Dashboard" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The Corona dashboard <b>stream</b> processing architecture.</figcaption></figure><p>To conclude both architectures and how they come together in a single application, see the following diagram:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption">

In my student dorm, I have electric curtains. They can be operated using a little remote, allowing one to open or close the curtains. This is pretty useful, because I don&apos;t even have to get out of bed to open my curtains &#x2013; I can just use the remote. But the remote uses radio waves to operate the curtains - and I have a Raspberry Pi laying around, doing nothing. What if I could operate the curtains using my Raspberry Pi? Such, that the curtains open at a certain time in the morning. In this way, my curtains would function as an alarm clock! In this project, I did exactly that &#x1F609;.</p><h3 id="how">How</h3><p>First, I have to figure out at all how to do this. Taking a look at the curtain remote, I found the brand to be &apos;<em>Somfy&apos;</em>. After some Google image searches I found the name of my remote model, the Somfy Telis 1-RTS:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/11/SOMFY-TELIS-1-RTS-old.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Automated curtains project" loading="lazy" width="300" height="300"><figcaption>My curtain remote. The goal is to emulate whatever signal it is sending to the curtains using a Raspberry Pi.</figcaption></figure><p>I want to emulate the RF (Radio Frequency) signal the remote is emitting. Such that, instead of pressing a button on the remote, I can control the curtains programmatically using code. Then, because the Raspberry Pi will always be on, I can configure certain times to open/close the curtains.</p><p>But surely, other people have wanted to do this too. Somfy is a popular brand for electric curtains after all. So, I searched, and found <a href="https://github.com/Nickduino/Pi-Somfy">Github project</a> containing code to control the curtains using a Raspberry Pi, if correctly assembled. Let&apos;s start!</p><h3 id="preparation">Preparation</h3><p>I need a couple things to make this work.</p><ol><li>Raspberry Pi (I am using a Raspberry Pi 2011 edition - Model B)</li><li>RF (Radio Frequency) transmitter (with an oscillator at 433.42 Mhz)</li><li>Cables to connect the RF emitter to the Raspberry Pi</li></ol><p>Most parts could easily be ordered through Ebay. However, Somfy did something smart in their product. They intentionally set their oscillator frequency to an odd number, 433.42 Mhz. Most other RF emitters run at 433.93 Mhz. There are, luckily, some places you can order a 433.42 oscillator. But only the oscillator. This means we are going to have to do some soldering to replace the oscillator. After a couple weeks, my parts arrived.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/11/Photo-from-Jeroen-Overschie-3.png" class="kg-image" alt="Automated curtains project" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="600" srcset="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/Photo-from-Jeroen-Overschie-3.png 600w, https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/11/Photo-from-Jeroen-Overschie-3.png 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The RF emitter on the left and a replacement part for changing its oscillator frequency on the right.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="building-the-pi-emitter">Building the Pi emitter</h3><p>My friend happened to possess a soldering set, so after a quick visit I managed to solder the correct oscillator onto the RF emitter board. &#xA0;Using a set of cables, I could attach the RF transmitter to the Raspberry Pi &#x1F64C;&#x1F3FB;.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-26-at-14.49.31.png" class="kg-image" alt="Automated curtains project" loading="lazy" width="1008" height="942" srcset="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-26-at-14.49.31.png 600w, https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-26-at-14.49.31.png 1000w, https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-26-at-14.49.31.png 1008w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The fully assembled Raspberry Pi, with its RF emitter attached via a cable.</figcaption></figure><p>I also bought an extra enclosure to keep the thing a bit more safe:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/11/image00003.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Automated curtains project" loading="lazy" width="540" height="720"><figcaption>Assembled Raspberry Pi RF transmitter, with enclosure.</figcaption></figure><p>Now all there&apos;s left is configure the correct software on the Raspberry Pi. Using the Github project I found, I was able to install the software and make the software automatically start on a reboot. It has a pretty neat interface, allowing one to set CRON jobs to open/close the curtains. In non-nerd speech we would just call this &apos;an alarm&apos; &#x1F605;.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/11/p3.png" class="kg-image" alt="Automated curtains project" loading="lazy" width="982" height="545" srcset="https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/p3.png 600w, https://jeroenoverschie.nl/content/images/2021/11/p3.png 982w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The Pi-Somfy interface.

Awesome! The project has succeeded and the cool thing is I have been using this every day ever since. The cool thing about doing a Computer Science degree is when you can apply your knowledge to solve real-world problems. When I leave this student dormitory, I will leave the Raspberry Pi right where it is, so others can also benefit from automated curtains &#x1F60A;.

In between lessons scheduled for the day, one would often have breaks in between. But because you chose a personalized package of classes to follow, everyone&apos;s schedule was also different. So, it would be hard to know with whom you could spend those breaks! To solve this, I developed this app. It allows students to find with whom they have breaks so they can hang out with them whilst waiting for the next class &#x1F60A;. The app was actually used by students in my school. Very cool! </p><h3 id="building-the-app">Building the app</h3><p>The entire app is quite sophisticated. The various components can be laid out as follows:</p><ul><li>Node.js backend (<a href="https://github.com/dunnkers/roosters-api">Github</a>)<br>- Has three main responsibilities:<br>(1) to scrape student schedules off HTML pages into a MongoDB database. Scraping is done using <a href="https://cheerio.js.org/">Cheerio</a> and communication with MongoDB via <a href="https://github.com/mongo-js/mongojs">MongoJS</a>.<br>(2) parse the schedules into a relational format and compute what odd break-time hours exist.<br>(3) expose the MongoDB database as an API.</li><li>Ember.js frontend (<a href="https://github.com/dunnkers/roosters">Github</a>)<br>- This front-end then consumes the API data using ember-data. I&apos;m using Bootstrap as a UI framework so I don&apos;t have to build all the buttons, tables and interfacing myself.</li></ul><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption">
