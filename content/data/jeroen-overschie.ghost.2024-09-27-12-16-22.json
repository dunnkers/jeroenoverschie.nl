Using a Python script, we created an index of the Tika codebase at every point in time. That is, we created a list of every Commit ID in the project.\n 2. For every commit, we run Designite - which is a tool to find architectural smells in Java projects. Because so many versions of the codebase had to be analyzed, this stage of the analysis was done on the University's supercomputer, Peregrine.\n 3. Using a Jupyter Notebook, we aggregate and summarize all information outputted by Designite. The amount of data to parse was large, so it was important to map-reduce as quickly as possible without losing critical information.\n\nSuch, we were able to visualize exactly at which time a component has been a God Component in the Tika codebase:\n\nFor more results, check out the complete Jupyter Notebook:\n\nGod Components in Apache TikaHow do God Components evolve in Apache Tika?

Among many possible activation functions (Nwankpa et al., 2018), a popular choice is the Rectified Linear Unit, or \"],[0,[2],1,\"ReLU\"],[0,[],0,\": $\\\\sigma(z)=\\\\max\\\\{0, z\\\\}$.

In this way, this text aims to build a bridge from the statistical, analytical world to the more approximative world of Machine Learning. We will not shy away from the math, whilst still working with tangible examples at all times: we will work with real-world datasets and we will get to apply our models as we go on. Let's start!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2>Linear Regression <small style=\"color:#ccc;\">(<a  style=\"color:#ccc;\" href=\"https://dunnkers.com/linear-regression-to-neural-networks/linear-regression.html\">Code</a>)</small></h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>First, we will explore linear regression, for it is an easy to understand model upon which we can build more sophisticated concepts. We will use a <a href=\"https://github.com/allisonhorst/penguins\">dataset</a> on Antarctican penguins (Gorman et al., 2014) to conduct a regression between the penguin <em>flipper length</em> as independent variable $X$ and the penguin <em>body mass</em> as the dependent variable $Y$. We can analytically solve Linear Regression by minimizing the <em>Residual Sum-of-Squares</em> cost function (Hastie et al., 2009):</p><p>$$\\text{R}(\\beta) = (Y - X \\beta)^T (Y - X \\beta)$$</p><p>In which $X$ is our <em>design matrix.</em> Regression using this loss function is also referred to as \"Ordinary Least Squares\". The mean of the cost function $\\text{R}$ over all samples is called Mean Squared Error, or MSE. Our design matrix is built by appending each data row with a bias constant of 1 - an alternative would be to first center our data to get rid of the intercept entirely. To now minimize our cost function we differentiate $\\text{R}$ with respect to $\\beta$, giving us the following unique minimum:</p><p>$$\\hat{\\beta} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y$$</p><p>... which results in the estimated least-squares coefficients given the training data, also called the <em>normal equation</em>. We can classify by simply multiplying our input data with the found coefficient matrix: $\\hat{Y} = X \\hat{\\beta}$. Let's observe our fitted regression line onto the data:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/12/linear-regression-flipper-vs-bodymass.svg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Linear Regression fit on Penguin data using the normal equation.

Using a validation data split of ¼ testing data and ¾ training data.</figcaption></figure><p>We can observe visually that our estimator explains both the training and testing data reasonably well: the line positioned itself along the mean of the data. This is in fact the proposition we make in least-squares - we assume the target to be Gaussian distributed; which in the case of modeling this natural phenomenon, penguins, seems to fit quite well.</p><p>Because at the moment we are very curious, we would also like to explore using a more flexible model. Note that our normal equation we defined above tries to find whatever parameters make the system of linear equations produce the best predictions on our target variable. This means, that hypothetically, we could add any linear combination of explanatory variables we like: such create estimators of a higher-order polynomial form. This is called <strong>polynomial regression</strong>. To illustrate, a design matrix for one explanatory variable $X_1$ would look as follows:</p><p>$$X= \\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}1 &amp; x_{1} &amp; x_{1}^{2} &amp; \\ldots &amp; x_{1}^{d} \\\\ 1 &amp; x_{2} &amp; x_{2}^{2} &amp; \\ldots &amp; x_{2}^{d} \\\\ 1 &amp; x_{3} &amp; x_{3}^{2} &amp; \\ldots &amp; x_{3}^{d} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 1 &amp; x_{n} &amp; x_{n}^{2} &amp; \\ldots &amp; x_{n}^{d}\\end{array}\\right]$$</p><p>Which results in $d$-th degree polynomial regression. The case $d=1$ is just normal linear regression. For example sake, let us sample only $n=10$ samples from our training dataset, and try to fit those with a polynomial regressors of increasing degrees. Let us observe what happens to the training and testing loss accordingly:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/12/polynomial-degrees.svg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Polynomial fits of various degrees on just $n=10$ training dataset samples. Testing dataset remained unchanged.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"576\" height=\"384\"><figcaption>Polynomial fits of various degrees on just $n=10$ training dataset samples. Testing dataset remained unchanged.</figcaption></figure><p>It can be observed that although for some degrees the losses remain almost the same, we suffer from overfitting after the degree passes $d=30$. We can also visually show how the polynomials of varying degrees fit our data:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/12/polynomial-fit.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/b7abbcf6-2bfe-492e-aa73-c4644924ec24/polynomial-fit.gif\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"432\" height=\"288\"></figure><p>We can indeed observe that the polynomials of higher degree definitely do not better explain our data. Also, the polynomials tend to get rather erratic beyond the last data points of the training data - which is important to consider whenever predicting outside the training data value ranges. Generally, polynomials of exceedingly high degree can overfit too easily and should only be considered in very special cases.</p><p>Up till now our experiments have been relatively simple - we used only one explanatory and one response variable. Let us now explore an example in which we use all available explanatory variables to predict body mass, to see whether we can achieve an even better fit. Because we are now at risk of suffering from <em>multicolinearity</em>; the situation where multiple explanatory variables are highly linearly related to each other, we will use an extension of linear regression which can deal with such a situation. The technique is called <strong>Ridge Regression</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"ridge-regression\">Ridge Regression</h3><p>In Ridge Regression, we aim to tamper the least squares tendency to get as 'flexible' as possible to fit the data best it can. This might, however, cause parameters to get very large. We therefore like to add a penalty on the regression parameters $\\beta$; we penalise the loss function with a square of the parameter vector $\\beta$ scaled by new hyperparameter $\\lambda$. This is called a <em>shrinkage method</em>, or also: <strong>regularization.</strong> This causes the squared loss function to become:</p><p>$$\\text{R}(\\beta) = (Y - X \\beta)^T (Y - X \\beta)+\\lambda \\beta^T \\beta$$</p><p>This is called regularization with an $L^2$ norm; which generalization is called Tikhonov regularization, which allows for the case where not every parameter scalar is regularized equally. If we were to use an $L^1$ norm instead, we would speak of LASSO regression. If we were to now derive the solutions of $\\beta$ given this new cost function by differentiation w.r.t. $\\beta$:</p><p>$$\\hat{\\beta}^{\\text {ridge }}=\\left(\\mathbf{X}^{T} \\mathbf{X}+\\lambda \\mathbf{I}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{T} \\mathbf{Y}$$</p><p>In which $\\lambda$ will be a scaling constant that controls the amount of regularization that is applied. Note $\\mathbf{I}$ is the $p\\times p$ identity matrix - in which $p$ are the amount of data dimensions used. An important intuition to be known about Ridge Regression, is that directions in the column space of $X$ with small variance will be shrinked the most; this behavior can be easily shown be deconstructing the least-squares fitted vector using a Singular Value Decomposition. That said, let us see whether we can benefit from this new technique in our experiment.</p><p>In the next experiment, we will now use <strong>all</strong> available quantitative variables to try and predict the Penguin body mass. The Penguin- bill length, bill depth and flipper length will be used as independent variables. Note, however, they might be somewhat correlated: see <a href=\"https://dunnkers.com/linear-regression-to-neural-networks/images/penguin-pairplot.svg\">this pairplot</a> on the Penguin data for details. This poses an interesting challenge for our regression. Let us combine this with varying dataset sample sizes and varying settings of $\\lambda$ to see the effects on our loss.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/12/ridge-vs-loss.svg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Ridge Regression using all quantitative variables in the Penguin dataset to predict body mass.

Varying subset sizes of the dataset $n$ as well as different regularization strengths $\\lambda$ are shown.</p><p>It can be observed, that using including all quantitative variables did improve the loss on predicting the Penguin body mass using Ridge Regression. In fact, the penalty imposed probably pulled the hyperplane angle down such that the error in fact increased. Ridge Regression is a very powerful technique, nonetheless, and most importantly introduced us to the concept of regularization. In the next chapters on Logistic Regression in Neural Networks, we assume all our models to use $L^2$ regularization.</p><p>Now, the data we fit up until now had only a small dimensionality - this is perhaps a drastic oversimplification in comparison to the real world. How does the analytic way of solving linear regression using the normal equation fare with <strong>higher-dimensional data</strong>?</p><h3 id=\"high-dimensional-data\">High-dimensional data</h3><p>In the real world, datasets might be of very high dimensionality: think of images, speech, or a biomedical dataset storing DNA sequences. These datasets cause different computational strain on the equations to be solved to fit a linear regression model: so let us <strong>simulate</strong> such a high-dimensional situation.</p><p>In our simulation the amount of dimensions will configured to outmatch the amount of dataset samples ($p \\gg n$), which extra dimensions we will create by simply adding some noise columns to the design matrix $X$. The noise will be drawn from a Gaussian distribution $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. We can now run an experiment by fitting our linear regression model to the higher-dimensional noised dataset, benchmarking the fitting times of the algorithm.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/12/Analytic_lower-vs-higher-dimensional.svg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Linear Regression fitting times for lower- and higher- dimensional Penguin data.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"225\" height=\"142\"><figcaption>Linear Regression fitting times for lower- and higher- dimensional Penguin data.</figcaption></figure><p>We can observe that the normal equation takes <strong>a lot</strong> longer to compute for higher-dimensional data. In fact, numerically computing the matrix inverse is very computationally expensive, i.e. computing $(X^TX)^{-1}$. Luckily, there are computationally cheaper techniques to do a regression in higher-dimensional spaces. One such technique is an iterative procedure, called <strong>Gradient Descent</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"gradient-descent\">Gradient Descent</h3><p>Instead of trying to analytically solve the system of linear equations at once, we can choose an iterative procedure instead, such as Gradient Descent. It works by computing the gradient of the cost function with respect to the model weights - such that we can then move in the opposite direction of the gradient in parameter space. Given some loss function $R(\\beta)$ and $R_i(\\beta)$, which computes the empirical loss for entire dataset and for the $i$-th observation, respectively, we can define one gradient descent step as:</p><p>$$\\begin{aligned} \\beta^{(r + 1)} &amp;= \\beta^{(r)} - \\gamma \\nabla_{\\beta^{(r)}} R(\\beta^{(r)}) \\\\ &amp;= \\beta^{(r)} - \\gamma \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{\\partial R_i(\\beta^{(r)})}{\\partial \\beta^{(r)}}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$</p><p>In which $\\gamma$ is the learning rate and $r$ indicates some iteration - given some initial parameters $\\beta^0$ and $N$ training samples. Using this equation, we are able to reduce the loss in every iteration, until we converge. Convergence occurs when every element of the gradient is zero - or very close to it. Although gradient descent is used in this vanilla form, two modifications are common: (1) <strong>subsampling</strong> and  using a (2) <strong>learning rate schedule</strong>.</p><ol><li>Although in a scenario in which our loss function landscape is convex the vanilla variant does converge toward the global optimum relatively easily, this might not be the case for non-convex error landscapes. We are at risk of getting stuck in local extremes. In this case, it is desirable to introduce some randomness — allowing us to jump out local extrema. We can introduce randomness by instead of computing the gradient over the entire sample set, we can do so for a random sample of the dataset called a <em>minibatch</em> (Goodfellow et al., 2014). A side effect is a lighter computational burden per iteration; sometimes causing faster convergence. Because the introduced randomness makes the procedure stochastic instead of deterministic, we call this algorithm <em>Stochastic</em> Gradient Descent, or simply <strong>SGD</strong>.</li><li>Accommodating SGD is often a learning rate schedule: making the learning rate parameter $\\gamma$ dependent on the iteration number $r$ such that $\\gamma = \\gamma^{(r)}$. In this way, we made the learning rate adaptive over time, allowing us to create a custom learning rate scheme. Many schemes (Dogo et al., 2018) exist - which can be used to avoid spending a long time on flat areas in the error landscape called plateaus, or to avoid 'overshooting' the optimal solution. Even, a technique analogous with <em>momentum</em> (Qian, 1999) in physics might be used: a particle traveling through space is 'accelerated' by the loss gradient, causing the gradient to change faster if it keeps going in the same direction.</li></ol><p>So, let's now redefine our gradient descent formula to accommodate for these modifications:</p><p>$$\\beta^{(r+1)}=\\beta^{(r)}-\\gamma^{(r)} \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\partial R_i(\\beta^{(r)})}{\\partial \\beta^{(r)}} $$</p><p>... where we, before each iteration, randomly shuffle our training dataset such that we draw $m$ random samples each step. The variable $m$ denotes the <em>batch size</em> - which can be anywhere between 1 and the amount of dataset samples minus one $N - 1$. The smaller the batch size, the more stochastic the procedure will get.</p><p>Using gradient descent for our linear regression is straight-forward. We differentiate the cost function with respect to the weights; the least squares derivative is then as follows:</p><p>$$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial R_i(\\beta^{(r)})}{\\partial \\beta^{(r)}} &amp;= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta^{(r)}} (y_i - x_i \\beta^{(r)})^2\\\\ &amp;= 2 (y_i - x_i \\beta^{(r)})\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$</p><p>We then run the algorithm in a loop, to iteratively get closer to the optimum parameter values.</p><p>Now, using this newly introduced iterative optimization procedure, let's see whether we can solve linear regression faster. First, we will compare SGD and the analytic method for our Penguin dataset with standard Gaussian noise dimensions added such that $p=2000$.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/12/SVGvsAnalytic_p2000.svg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Fitting time and MSE loss differences of Linear Regression solved using SGD and analytically using the normal equation. 10 experiments are shown; each one is a dot.

Because the analytic method always finds the optimum value, it is most plausible that SGD does not achieve the same performance - as can be seen in the MSE loss in the figure. Only in a couple of runs does SGD achieve near-optimum performance - in the other cases the algorithm was either stopped by its maximum iterations limit or it got stuck in some local extrema and has not gotten out yet. If we wanted to get better results, we could have used a more lenient maximum amount of iterations or a stricter convergence condition. This is a clear trade-off between computational workload and the optimality of the solution. We can run some more experiments for various levels of augmented dimensions:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/12/SVGvsAnalytic_many_p.svg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Fitting time and MSE loss for several degrees of dataset dimensionality.

SGD does suffer a higher loss due to its approximative nature - but this might just be worth the trade-off.</p><p>Now that we have gotten familiar with Gradient Descent, we can explore a realm of techniques that rely on being solved iteratively. Instead of doing regression, we will now try to <strong>classify</strong> penguins by their species type — a method for doing so is <strong>Logistic Regression</strong>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2>Logistic Regression <small style=\"color:#ccc;\">(<a  style=\"color:#ccc;\" href=\"https://dunnkers.com/linear-regression-to-neural-networks/logistic-regression.html\">Code</a>)</small></h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In general, linear regression is no good for classification.

This can be written as:</p><p>$$\\begin{aligned} \\Pr(G=2|X;\\beta)&amp;=S(X\\beta)\\\\ &amp;=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-X\\beta)}\\\\ &amp;=p(X;\\beta) \\end{aligned}$$</p><p>Because we consider only two classes, we can compute one probability and infer the other one, like so:</p><p>$$\\begin{aligned} \\Pr(G=1|X;\\beta)&amp;=1-p(X;\\beta) \\end{aligned}$$</p><p>For which it can be easily seen that both probabilities form a <em>probability vector</em>, i.e. their values sum to 1. Note we can consider the targets as a sequence of <em>Bernoulli trials</em> $y_i,\\dots,y_N$ - each outcome a binary - assuming all observations are independent of one another. This allows us to write:</p><p>$$\\begin{aligned} \\Pr (y| X;\\beta)&amp;=p(X;\\beta)^y(1-p(X;\\beta))^{(1-y)}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$</p><p>So, how to approximate $\\beta$? Like in linear regression, we can optimize a loss function to obtain an estimator $\\hat{\\beta}$. We can express the loss function as a likelihood using <em>Maximum Likelihood Estimation</em>. First, we express our objective into a conditional <strong>likelihood</strong> function.</p><p>$$\\begin{aligned} L(\\beta)&amp;=\\Pr (Y| X;\\beta)\\\\ &amp;=\\prod_{i=1}^N \\Pr (y_i|X=x_i;\\beta)\\\\ &amp;=\\prod_{i=1}^N p(x_i;\\beta)^{y_i}(1-p(x_i;\\beta))^{(1-y_i)} \\end{aligned}$$</p><p>The likelihood becomes easier to maximize in practice if we rewrite the product to a sum using a logarithm; such scaling does not change the resulting parameters. We obtain the <strong>log-likelihood</strong> (Bischop, 2006):</p><p>$$\\begin{aligned} \\ell(\\beta)&amp;=\\log L(\\beta)\\\\ &amp;=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left\\{y_{i} \\log p\\left(x_{i} ; \\beta\\right)+\\left(1-y_{i}\\right) \\log \\left(1-p\\left(x_{i} ; \\beta\\right)\\right)\\right\\}\\\\ &amp;=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left\\{y_{i} \\beta^{T} x_{i}-\\log \\left(1+e^{\\beta^{T} x_{i}}\\right)\\right\\} \\end{aligned}$$</p><p>Also called the <strong><em>logistic loss</em></strong>; which multi-dimensional counterpart is the <em>cross-entropy</em> loss. We can maximize this likelihood function by computing its gradient:</p><p>$$\\frac{\\partial \\ell(\\beta)}{\\partial \\beta}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}\\left(y_{i}-p\\left(x_{i} ; \\beta\\right)\\right)$$</p><p>...resulting in $p+1$ equations nonlinear in $\\beta$. The equation is <em>transcendental</em>: meaning no closed-form solution exists and hence we cannot simply solve for zero. It is possible, however, to use numerical approximations: Newton-Raphson method based strategies can be used, such as Newton Conjugate-Gradient, or quasi-Newton procedures might be used such as L-BFGS (Zhu et al., 1997). Different strategies have varying benefits based on the problem type, e.g. the amount of samples $n$ or dimensions $p$. Since the gradient can be approximated just fine, we can also simply use Gradient Descent, i.e. SGD.</p><p>In the case where more response variables are to be predicted, i.e. $K&gt;2$, a <strong>multinomial</strong> variant of Logistic Regression can be used. For easier implementation, some software implementations just perform multiple binomial logistic regressions in order to conduct a multinomial one; which is called a One-versus-All strategy. The resulting probabilities are then normalized to still output a probability vector (Pedregosa et al., 2001).</p><p>That theory out of the way, let's fit a Logistic Regression model to our penguin data! We will try to classify whether a penguin is a Chinstrap yes or no, in other words: we will perform a binomial logistic regression. We will perform 30K iterations, each iteration an epoch over the training data:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/12/logistic-metrics.svg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Logistic Regression model fit on a binary penguin classification task.

We can also visualize our model fit over time: by predicting over a grid of values at every time step during training. This yields the following animation:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/12/logistic-fit.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Logistic Regression model fit using SGD with constant learning rate of $\\gamma=0.001$ and $L^2$ regularization using $\\alpha=0.0005$ .\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"432\" height=\"288\"><figcaption>Logistic Regression model fit using SGD with constant learning rate of $\\gamma=0.001$ and $L^2$ regularization using $\\alpha=0.0005$.</figcaption></figure><p>Clearly, our decision boundary is not optimal yet - whilst the data is somewhat Gaussian distributed our model linearly separates the data. We can do better — we need some way to introduce more non-linearity into our model. A model that does just so is a <strong>Neural Network</strong>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2>Neural Network <small style=\"color:#ccc;\">(<a  style=\"color:#ccc;\" href=\"https://dunnkers.com/linear-regression-to-neural-networks/neural-network.html\">Code</a>)</small></h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>At last, we arrive at the Neural Network. Using the previously learned concepts, we are really not that far off from assembling a Neural Network. Really, a single-layer Neural Network essentially just a linear model, like before. The difference is, that we conduct some extra projections in order to make the data better linearly separable. In a Neural Network, we aim to find the parameters facilitating such projections automatically. We call each such projection a <em>Hidden Layer</em>. After having conducted a suitable projection,  we can pull the projected data through a logistic function to estimate a probability - similarly to logistic regression. One such architecture is like so:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/12/nn.svg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Neural Network architecture for 2-dimensional inputs and a 1-dimensional output with $l=3$ hidden layers each containing 5 neurons (image generated using NN-SVG).\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Neural Network architecture for 2-dimensional inputs and a 1-dimensional output with $l=3$ hidden layers each containing 5 neurons (image generated using <a href=\"http://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/\">NN-SVG</a>).</figcaption></figure><p>So, given one input vector $x_i$, we can compute its estimated value by feeding its values through the network from left to right, in each layer multiplying with its parameter vector. We call this type of network <em>feed-forward</em>. Networks that do not feed forward include <em>recurrent</em> or <em>recursive</em> networks, though we will only concern ourselves with feed-forward networks for now.</p><p>An essential component of any such network is an <strong><em>activation function</em>;</strong> a <em>non-linear</em> differentiable function mapping $\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, aimed to overcome model linearity constraints. We apply the activation function to every hidden node; we compute the total input, add a bias, and then activate. This process is somewhat analogous to what happens in neurons in the brain - hence the name Neural Network. Among many possible activation functions (Nwankpa et al., 2018), a popular choice is the Rectified Linear Unit, or <strong>ReLU</strong>: $\\sigma(z)=\\max\\{0, z\\}$. It looks as follows:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/12/relu.svg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"ReLU activation function $\\sigma(z)=\\max \\{0,z\\}$. The function is easily seen to be piecewise-linear.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"480\" height=\"384\"><figcaption>ReLU activation function $\\sigma(z)=\\max \\{0,z\\}$. The function is easily seen to be piecewise-linear.</figcaption></figure><p>Also because ReLU is just a max operation, it is fast to compute (e.g. compared to a sigmoid). Using our activation function, we can define a <em>forward-pass</em> through our network, as follows:</p><p>$$\\begin{aligned} h^{(1)}&amp;=\\sigma(X W^{(1)} + b^{(1)})\\\\ h^{(2)}&amp;=\\sigma(h^{(1)} W^{(2)} + b^{(2)})\\\\ h^{(3)}&amp;=\\sigma(h^{(2)} W^{(3)} + b^{(3)})\\\\ \\hat{Y}&amp;=S(h^{(3)}W^{(4)}+b^{(4)}) \\end{aligned}$$</p><p>In which $h$ resembles the intermediate projections indexed by its hidden layer; and the parameters $\\beta$ mapping every two layers together are accessible through $W$. A bias vector is accessible through $b$, such to add a bias term to every node in the layer. Finally, we apply a Sigmoid to the results of the last layer to receive probability estimates; in the case of multi-class outputs its multi-dimensional counterpart is used, the <em>Softmax</em>, which normalizes the logistic function such to produce a probability vector. Do note that the activation function <em>could</em> differ per layer; and in practice, this might happen. In our case, we will just use one activation function for all hidden layers in our network.</p><p>We are also going to have to define a <strong>cost function</strong>, such to be able to optimize the parameters based on its gradient. We can do so using the minimizing the negative log-likelihood using Maximum Likelihood, given some loss function such as:</p><p>$$ R(\\theta)=-\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}\\sim\\hat{p}_{\\text{data }}}\\log p_{\\operatorname{model}}(\\boldsymbol{y}\\mid\\boldsymbol{x}) $$</p><p>In which we combined weights $W$ and biases $b$ into a single parameter term $\\theta$. Our cost function says to quantify the chance of encountering a target $y$ given an input vector $x$. Suitable loss functions to be used are log-loss/cross-entropy, or simply squared error:</p><p>$$ R(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}\\sim\\hat{p}_{\\text{data }}}\\|\\boldsymbol{y}-f(\\boldsymbol{x} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\|^{2}+ \\text{const} $$</p><p>Assuming $p_{\\text{model}}(y|x)$ to be Gaussian distributed. Of course, in any implementation we can only approach the expected value by averaging over a discrete set of observations; thus allowing us to compute the loss of our network.</p><p>Now that we are able to do a forward pass by (1) making predictions given a set of parameters $\\theta$ and (2) computing its loss using a cost function $R(\\theta)$, we will have to figure out how to actually <strong>train</strong> our network. Because our computation involves quite some operations by now, computing the gradient of the cost function is not trivial - to approximate the full gradient one would have to compute partial derivatives with respect to every weight separately. Luckily, we can exploit the calculus chain rule to break up the problem into smaller pieces: allowing us to much more efficiently re-use previously computed answers. The algorithm using this trick is called <strong>back-propagation</strong>.</p><p>In back-propagation, we re-visit the network in reverse order; i.e. starting at the output layer and working our way back to the input layer. We then use the calculus derivative chain rule (Goodfellow et al., 2014):</p><p>$$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x_{i}}&amp;=\\sum_{j} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y_{j}} \\frac{\\partial y_{j}}{\\partial x_{i}}\\\\ &amp;\\text{in vector notation:}\\\\ \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{x}} z&amp;=\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{y}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{x}}\\right)^{\\top} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{y}} z \\end{aligned}$$</p><p>...to compute the gradient in modular fashion. Note we need to consider the network in its entirety when computing the partial derivatives; the output activation, the loss function, node activations and the biases. To systematically apply back-prop to a network often these functions are abstracted as being an <em>operation</em> - which can then be assembled in a <em>computational graph</em>. Given a suitable such graph, many generic back-prop implementations can be used.</p><p>Once we have now computed the derivative of the cost function $R(\\theta)$, our situation became similar to when we iteratively solved linear- or logistic regression: we can now use just Gradient Descent to move in the error landscape.</p><p>Now that we know how to train a Neural Network, let's apply it! We aim to get better accuracy for our Penguin classification problem than using our Logistic Regression model.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/12/neural-metrics.svg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Neural Network fit on a binary penguin classification task.

However, we do not always require the full complexity of a Neural Network: sometimes, a simpler model will do the job just fine. In this project, we take a journey starting from the most fundamental statistical machinery to model data distributions, linear regression, to then explain the benefits of constructing more complex models, such as logistic regression or a Neural Network. In this way, this text aims to build a bridge from the statistical, analytical world to the more approximative world of Machine Learning. We will not shy away from the math, whilst still working with tangible examples at all times: we will work with real-world datasets and we will get to apply our models as we go on. Let's start!\n\n\nLinear Regression (Code)\n\nFirst, we will explore linear regression, for it is an easy to understand model upon which we can build more sophisticated concepts. We will use a dataset on Antarctican penguins (Gorman et al., 2014) to conduct a regression between the penguin flipper length as independent variable $X$ and the penguin body mass as the dependent variable $Y$. We can analytically solve Linear Regression by minimizing the Residual Sum-of-Squares cost function (Hastie et al., 2009):\n\n$$\\text{R}(\\beta) = (Y - X \\beta)^T (Y - X \\beta)$$\n\nIn which $X$ is our design matrix. Regression using this loss function is also referred to as \"Ordinary Least Squares\". The mean of the cost function $\\text{R}$ over all samples is called Mean Squared Error, or MSE. Our design matrix is built by appending each data row with a bias constant of 1 - an alternative would be to first center our data to get rid of the intercept entirely. To now minimize our cost function we differentiate $\\text{R}$ with respect to $\\beta$, giving us the following unique minimum:\n\n$$\\hat{\\beta} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y$$\n\n... which results in the estimated least-squares coefficients given the training data, also called the normal equation. We can classify by simply multiplying our input data with the found coefficient matrix: $\\hat{Y} = X \\hat{\\beta}$. Let's observe our fitted regression line onto the data:\n\nWe can observe visually that our estimator explains both the training and testing data reasonably well: the line positioned itself along the mean of the data. This is in fact the proposition we make in least-squares - we assume the target to be Gaussian distributed; which in the case of modeling this natural phenomenon, penguins, seems to fit quite well.\n\nBecause at the moment we are very curious, we would also like to explore using a more flexible model. Note that our normal equation we defined above tries to find whatever parameters make the system of linear equations produce the best predictions on our target variable. This means, that hypothetically, we could add any linear combination of explanatory variables we like: such create estimators of a higher-order polynomial form. This is called polynomial regression. To illustrate, a design matrix for one explanatory variable $X_1$ would look as follows:\n\n$$X= \\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}1 & x_{1} & x_{1}^{2} & \\ldots & x_{1}^{d} \\\\ 1 & x_{2} & x_{2}^{2} & \\ldots & x_{2}^{d} \\\\ 1 & x_{3} & x_{3}^{2} & \\ldots & x_{3}^{d} \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ 1 & x_{n} & x_{n}^{2} & \\ldots & x_{n}^{d}\\end{array}\\right]$$\n\nWhich results in $d$-th degree polynomial regression. The case $d=1$ is just normal linear regression. For example sake, let us sample only $n=10$ samples from our training dataset, and try to fit those with a polynomial regressors of increasing degrees. Let us observe what happens to the training and testing loss accordingly:\n\nIt can be observed that although for some degrees the losses remain almost the same, we suffer from overfitting after the degree passes $d=30$. We can also visually show how the polynomials of varying degrees fit our data:\n\nWe can indeed observe that the polynomials of higher degree definitely do not better explain our data. Also, the polynomials tend to get rather erratic beyond the last data points of the training data - which is important to consider whenever predicting outside the training data value ranges. Generally, polynomials of exceedingly high degree can overfit too easily and should only be considered in very special cases.\n\nUp till now our experiments have been relatively simple - we used only one explanatory and one response variable. Let us now explore an example in which we use all available explanatory variables to predict body mass, to see whether we can achieve an even better fit. Because we are now at risk of suffering from multicolinearity; the situation where multiple explanatory variables are highly linearly related to each other, we will use an extension of linear regression which can deal with such a situation. The technique is called Ridge Regression.\n\n\nRidge Regression\n\nIn Ridge Regression, we aim to tamper the least squares tendency to get as 'flexible' as possible to fit the data best it can. This might, however, cause parameters to get very large. We therefore like to add a penalty on the regression parameters $\\beta$; we penalise the loss function with a square of the parameter vector $\\beta$ scaled by new hyperparameter $\\lambda$. This is called a shrinkage method, or also: regularization. This causes the squared loss function to become:\n\n$$\\text{R}(\\beta) = (Y - X \\beta)^T (Y - X \\beta)+\\lambda \\beta^T \\beta$$\n\nThis is called regularization with an $L^2$ norm; which generalization is called Tikhonov regularization, which allows for the case where not every parameter scalar is regularized equally. If we were to use an $L^1$ norm instead, we would speak of LASSO regression. If we were to now derive the solutions of $\\beta$ given this new cost function by differentiation w.r.t. $\\beta$:\n\n$$\\hat{\\beta}^{\\text {ridge }}=\\left(\\mathbf{X}^{T} \\mathbf{X}+\\lambda \\mathbf{I}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{T} \\mathbf{Y}$$\n\nIn which $\\lambda$ will be a scaling constant that controls the amount of regularization that is applied. Note $\\mathbf{I}$ is the $p\\times p$ identity matrix - in which $p$ are the amount of data dimensions used. An important intuition to be known about Ridge Regression, is that directions in the column space of $X$ with small variance will be shrinked the most; this behavior can be easily shown be deconstructing the least-squares fitted vector using a Singular Value Decomposition. That said, let us see whether we can benefit from this new technique in our experiment.\n\nIn the next experiment, we will now use all available quantitative variables to try and predict the Penguin body mass. The Penguin- bill length, bill depth and flipper length will be used as independent variables. Note, however, they might be somewhat correlated: see this pairplot on the Penguin data for details. This poses an interesting challenge for our regression. Let us combine this with varying dataset sample sizes and varying settings of $\\lambda$ to see the effects on our loss.\n\nRidge Regression using all quantitative variables in the Penguin dataset to predict body mass. Varying subset sizes of the dataset $n$ as well as different regularization strengths $\\lambda$ are shown.\n\nIt can be observed, that using including all quantitative variables did improve the loss on predicting the Penguin body mass using Ridge Regression. In fact, the penalty imposed probably pulled the hyperplane angle down such that the error in fact increased. Ridge Regression is a very powerful technique, nonetheless, and most importantly introduced us to the concept of regularization. In the next chapters on Logistic Regression in Neural Networks, we assume all our models to use $L^2$ regularization.\n\nNow, the data we fit up until now had only a small dimensionality - this is perhaps a drastic oversimplification in comparison to the real world. How does the analytic way of solving linear regression using the normal equation fare with higher-dimensional data?\n\n\nHigh-dimensional data\n\nIn the real world, datasets might be of very high dimensionality: think of images, speech, or a biomedical dataset storing DNA sequences. These datasets cause different computational strain on the equations to be solved to fit a linear regression model: so let us simulate such a high-dimensional situation.\n\nIn our simulation the amount of dimensions will configured to outmatch the amount of dataset samples ($p \\gg n$), which extra dimensions we will create by simply adding some noise columns to the design matrix $X$. The noise will be drawn from a Gaussian distribution $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. We can now run an experiment by fitting our linear regression model to the higher-dimensional noised dataset, benchmarking the fitting times of the algorithm.\n\nWe can observe that the normal equation takes a lot longer to compute for higher-dimensional data. In fact, numerically computing the matrix inverse is very computationally expensive, i.e. computing $(X^TX)^{-1}$. Luckily, there are computationally cheaper techniques to do a regression in higher-dimensional spaces. One such technique is an iterative procedure, called Gradient Descent.\n\n\nGradient Descent\n\nInstead of trying to analytically solve the system of linear equations at once, we can choose an iterative procedure instead, such as Gradient Descent. It works by computing the gradient of the cost function with respect to the model weights - such that we can then move in the opposite direction of the gradient in parameter space. Given some loss function $R(\\beta)$ and $R_i(\\beta)$, which computes the empirical loss for entire dataset and for the $i$-th observation, respectively, we can define one gradient descent step as:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\beta^{(r + 1)} &= \\beta^{(r)} - \\gamma \\nabla_{\\beta^{(r)}} R(\\beta^{(r)}) \\\\ &= \\beta^{(r)} - \\gamma \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{\\partial R_i(\\beta^{(r)})}{\\partial \\beta^{(r)}}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$\n\nIn which $\\gamma$ is the learning rate and $r$ indicates some iteration - given some initial parameters $\\beta^0$ and $N$ training samples. Using this equation, we are able to reduce the loss in every iteration, until we converge. Convergence occurs when every element of the gradient is zero - or very close to it. Although gradient descent is used in this vanilla form, two modifications are common: (1) subsampling and  using a (2) learning rate schedule.\n\n 1. Although in a scenario in which our loss function landscape is convex the vanilla variant does converge toward the global optimum relatively easily, this might not be the case for non-convex error landscapes. We are at risk of getting stuck in local extremes. In this case, it is desirable to introduce some randomness — allowing us to jump out local extrema. We can introduce randomness by instead of computing the gradient over the entire sample set, we can do so for a random sample of the dataset called a minibatch (Goodfellow et al., 2014). A side effect is a lighter computational burden per iteration; sometimes causing faster convergence. Because the introduced randomness makes the procedure stochastic instead of deterministic, we call this algorithm Stochastic Gradient Descent, or simply SGD.\n 2. Accommodating SGD is often a learning rate schedule: making the learning rate parameter $\\gamma$ dependent on the iteration number $r$ such that $\\gamma = \\gamma^{(r)}$. In this way, we made the learning rate adaptive over time, allowing us to create a custom learning rate scheme. Many schemes (Dogo et al., 2018) exist - which can be used to avoid spending a long time on flat areas in the error landscape called plateaus, or to avoid 'overshooting' the optimal solution. Even, a technique analogous with momentum (Qian, 1999) in physics might be used: a particle traveling through space is 'accelerated' by the loss gradient, causing the gradient to change faster if it keeps going in the same direction.\n\nSo, let's now redefine our gradient descent formula to accommodate for these modifications:\n\n$$\\beta^{(r+1)}=\\beta^{(r)}-\\gamma^{(r)} \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\partial R_i(\\beta^{(r)})}{\\partial \\beta^{(r)}} $$\n\n... where we, before each iteration, randomly shuffle our training dataset such that we draw $m$ random samples each step. The variable $m$ denotes the batch size - which can be anywhere between 1 and the amount of dataset samples minus one $N - 1$. The smaller the batch size, the more stochastic the procedure will get.\n\nUsing gradient descent for our linear regression is straight-forward. We differentiate the cost function with respect to the weights; the least squares derivative is then as follows:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial R_i(\\beta^{(r)})}{\\partial \\beta^{(r)}} &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta^{(r)}} (y_i - x_i \\beta^{(r)})^2\\\\ &= 2 (y_i - x_i \\beta^{(r)})\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$\n\nWe then run the algorithm in a loop, to iteratively get closer to the optimum parameter values.\n\nNow, using this newly introduced iterative optimization procedure, let's see whether we can solve linear regression faster. First, we will compare SGD and the analytic method for our Penguin dataset with standard Gaussian noise dimensions added such that $p=2000$.\n\nIndeed - our iterative procedure is faster for such a high-dimensional dataset. Because the analytic method always finds the optimum value, it is most plausible that SGD does not achieve the same performance - as can be seen in the MSE loss in the figure. Only in a couple of runs does SGD achieve near-optimum performance - in the other cases the algorithm was either stopped by its maximum iterations limit or it got stuck in some local extrema and has not gotten out yet. If we wanted to get better results, we could have used a more lenient maximum amount of iterations or a stricter convergence condition. This is a clear trade-off between computational workload and the optimality of the solution. We can run some more experiments for various levels of augmented dimensions:\n\nIn which we can empirically show that for our experiment, the analytic computation time grows about exponentially whilst SGD causes only a mild increase in computational time. SGD does suffer a higher loss due to its approximative nature - but this might just be worth the trade-off.\n\nNow that we have gotten familiar with Gradient Descent, we can explore a realm of techniques that rely on being solved iteratively. Instead of doing regression, we will now try to classify penguins by their species type — a method for doing so is Logistic Regression.\n\n\nLogistic Regression (Code)\n\nIn general, linear regression is no good for classification. There is no notion incorporated into the objective function to desire a hyperplane that best separates two classes. Even if we would encode qualitative target variables in a quantitative way, i.e. in zeros or ones, a normal equation fit would result in predicted values outside the target range.\n\nTherefore, we require a different scheme. In Logistic Regression, we first want to make sure all estimations remain in $[0,1]$. This can be done using the Sigmoid function:\n\n$$S(z)=\\frac{e^z}{e^z+1}=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$$\n\nAlso called the Logistic function. So, the goal is to predict some class $G \\in \\{1,\\dots,K\\}$ given inputs $X$. We assume an intercept constant of 1 to be embedded in $X$. Now let us take a closer look at the case where $K=2$, i.e. the binary or binomial case.\n\nIf we were to encode our class targets $Y$ as either ones or zeros, i.e. $Y \\in \\{0,1\\}$, we can predict values using $X \\beta$ and pull them through a sigmoid $S(X\\beta)$ to obtain the probabilities whether samples belongs to the class encoded as 1. This can be written as:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\Pr(G=2|X;\\beta)&=S(X\\beta)\\\\ &=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-X\\beta)}\\\\ &=p(X;\\beta) \\end{aligned}$$\n\nBecause we consider only two classes, we can compute one probability and infer the other one, like so:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\Pr(G=1|X;\\beta)&=1-p(X;\\beta) \\end{aligned}$$\n\nFor which it can be easily seen that both probabilities form a probability vector, i.e. their values sum to 1. Note we can consider the targets as a sequence of Bernoulli trials $y_i,\\dots,y_N$ - each outcome a binary - assuming all observations are independent of one another. This allows us to write:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\Pr (y| X;\\beta)&=p(X;\\beta)^y(1-p(X;\\beta))^{(1-y)}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$\n\nSo, how to approximate $\\beta$? Like in linear regression, we can optimize a loss function to obtain an estimator $\\hat{\\beta}$. We can express the loss function as a likelihood using Maximum Likelihood Estimation. First, we express our objective into a conditional likelihood function.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} L(\\beta)&=\\Pr (Y| X;\\beta)\\\\ &=\\prod_{i=1}^N \\Pr (y_i|X=x_i;\\beta)\\\\ &=\\prod_{i=1}^N p(x_i;\\beta)^{y_i}(1-p(x_i;\\beta))^{(1-y_i)} \\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe likelihood becomes easier to maximize in practice if we rewrite the product to a sum using a logarithm; such scaling does not change the resulting parameters. We obtain the log-likelihood (Bischop, 2006):\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\ell(\\beta)&=\\log L(\\beta)\\\\ &=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left\\{y_{i} \\log p\\left(x_{i} ; \\beta\\right)+\\left(1-y_{i}\\right) \\log \\left(1-p\\left(x_{i} ; \\beta\\right)\\right)\\right\\}\\\\ &=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left\\{y_{i} \\beta^{T} x_{i}-\\log \\left(1+e^{\\beta^{T} x_{i}}\\right)\\right\\} \\end{aligned}$$\n\nAlso called the logistic loss; which multi-dimensional counterpart is the cross-entropy loss. We can maximize this likelihood function by computing its gradient:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\ell(\\beta)}{\\partial \\beta}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}\\left(y_{i}-p\\left(x_{i} ; \\beta\\right)\\right)$$\n\n...resulting in $p+1$ equations nonlinear in $\\beta$. The equation is transcendental: meaning no closed-form solution exists and hence we cannot simply solve for zero. It is possible, however, to use numerical approximations: Newton-Raphson method based strategies can be used, such as Newton Conjugate-Gradient, or quasi-Newton procedures might be used such as L-BFGS (Zhu et al., 1997). Different strategies have varying benefits based on the problem type, e.g. the amount of samples $n$ or dimensions $p$. Since the gradient can be approximated just fine, we can also simply use Gradient Descent, i.e. SGD.\n\nIn the case where more response variables are to be predicted, i.e. $K>2$, a multinomial variant of Logistic Regression can be used. For easier implementation, some software implementations just perform multiple binomial logistic regressions in order to conduct a multinomial one; which is called a One-versus-All strategy. The resulting probabilities are then normalized to still output a probability vector (Pedregosa et al., 2001).\n\nThat theory out of the way, let's fit a Logistic Regression model to our penguin data! We will try to classify whether a penguin is a Chinstrap yes or no, in other words: we will perform a binomial logistic regression. We will perform 30K iterations, each iteration an epoch over the training data:\n\nWe can observe that the model converged to a stable state already after about 10K epochs - we could have implemented an early stopping rule; for example by checking whether validation scores stop improving or when our loss is no longer changing much. We can also visualize our model fit over time: by predicting over a grid of values at every time step during training. This yields the following animation:\n\nClearly, our decision boundary is not optimal yet - whilst the data is somewhat Gaussian distributed our model linearly separates the data. We can do better — we need some way to introduce more non-linearity into our model. A model that does just so is a Neural Network.\n\n\nNeural Network (Code)\n\nAt last, we arrive at the Neural Network. Using the previously learned concepts, we are really not that far off from assembling a Neural Network. Really, a single-layer Neural Network essentially just a linear model, like before. The difference is, that we conduct some extra projections in order to make the data better linearly separable. In a Neural Network, we aim to find the parameters facilitating such projections automatically. We call each such projection a Hidden Layer. After having conducted a suitable projection,  we can pull the projected data through a logistic function to estimate a probability - similarly to logistic regression. One such architecture is like so:\n\nSo, given one input vector $x_i$, we can compute its estimated value by feeding its values through the network from left to right, in each layer multiplying with its parameter vector. We call this type of network feed-forward. Networks that do not feed forward include recurrent or recursive networks, though we will only concern ourselves with feed-forward networks for now.\n\nAn essential component of any such network is an activation function; a non-linear differentiable function mapping $\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, aimed to overcome model linearity constraints. We apply the activation function to every hidden node; we compute the total input, add a bias, and then activate. This process is somewhat analogous to what happens in neurons in the brain - hence the name Neural Network. Among many possible activation functions (Nwankpa et al., 2018), a popular choice is the Rectified Linear Unit, or ReLU: $\\sigma(z)=\\max\\{0, z\\}$. It looks as follows:\n\nAlso because ReLU is just a max operation, it is fast to compute (e.g. compared to a sigmoid). Using our activation function, we can define a forward-pass through our network, as follows:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} h^{(1)}&=\\sigma(X W^{(1)} + b^{(1)})\\\\ h^{(2)}&=\\sigma(h^{(1)} W^{(2)} + b^{(2)})\\\\ h^{(3)}&=\\sigma(h^{(2)} W^{(3)} + b^{(3)})\\\\ \\hat{Y}&=S(h^{(3)}W^{(4)}+b^{(4)}) \\end{aligned}$$\n\nIn which $h$ resembles the intermediate projections indexed by its hidden layer; and the parameters $\\beta$ mapping every two layers together are accessible through $W$. A bias vector is accessible through $b$, such to add a bias term to every node in the layer. Finally, we apply a Sigmoid to the results of the last layer to receive probability estimates; in the case of multi-class outputs its multi-dimensional counterpart is used, the Softmax, which normalizes the logistic function such to produce a probability vector. Do note that the activation function could differ per layer; and in practice, this might happen. In our case, we will just use one activation function for all hidden layers in our network.\n\nWe are also going to have to define a cost function, such to be able to optimize the parameters based on its gradient. We can do so using the minimizing the negative log-likelihood using Maximum Likelihood, given some loss function such as:\n\n$$ R(\\theta)=-\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}\\sim\\hat{p}_{\\text{data }}}\\log p_{\\operatorname{model}}(\\boldsymbol{y}\\mid\\boldsymbol{x}) $$\n\nIn which we combined weights $W$ and biases $b$ into a single parameter term $\\theta$. Our cost function says to quantify the chance of encountering a target $y$ given an input vector $x$. Suitable loss functions to be used are log-loss/cross-entropy, or simply squared error:\n\n$$ R(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}\\sim\\hat{p}_{\\text{data }}}\\|\\boldsymbol{y}-f(\\boldsymbol{x} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\|^{2}+ \\text{const} $$\n\nAssuming $p_{\\text{model}}(y|x)$ to be Gaussian distributed. Of course, in any implementation we can only approach the expected value by averaging over a discrete set of observations; thus allowing us to compute the loss of our network.\n\nNow that we are able to do a forward pass by (1) making predictions given a set of parameters $\\theta$ and (2) computing its loss using a cost function $R(\\theta)$, we will have to figure out how to actually train our network. Because our computation involves quite some operations by now, computing the gradient of the cost function is not trivial - to approximate the full gradient one would have to compute partial derivatives with respect to every weight separately. Luckily, we can exploit the calculus chain rule to break up the problem into smaller pieces: allowing us to much more efficiently re-use previously computed answers. The algorithm using this trick is called back-propagation.\n\nIn back-propagation, we re-visit the network in reverse order; i.e. starting at the output layer and working our way back to the input layer. We then use the calculus derivative chain rule (Goodfellow et al., 2014):\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x_{i}}&=\\sum_{j} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y_{j}} \\frac{\\partial y_{j}}{\\partial x_{i}}\\\\ &\\text{in vector notation:}\\\\ \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{x}} z&=\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{y}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{x}}\\right)^{\\top} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{y}} z \\end{aligned}$$\n\n...to compute the gradient in modular fashion. Note we need to consider the network in its entirety when computing the partial derivatives; the output activation, the loss function, node activations and the biases. To systematically apply back-prop to a network often these functions are abstracted as being an operation - which can then be assembled in a computational graph. Given a suitable such graph, many generic back-prop implementations can be used.\n\nOnce we have now computed the derivative of the cost function $R(\\theta)$, our situation became similar to when we iteratively solved linear- or logistic regression: we can now use just Gradient Descent to move in the error landscape.\n\nNow that we know how to train a Neural Network, let's apply it! We aim to get better accuracy for our Penguin classification problem than using our Logistic Regression model.\n\nIndeed, our more flexible Neural Network model better fits the data. The NN achieves 94.9% testing accuracy, in comparison to 89.7% testing accuracy for the Logistic Regression model. Let's see how our model is fitted over time:\n\nIn which it can be observed that the model converged after some 750 iterations. Intuitively, the decision region looks to have been approximated fairly well - it might just have been slightly 'stretched' out.\n\n\nEnding note\n\nNow that we have been able to fit a more 'complicated' data distribution, we conclude our journey from simple statistical models such a linear regression up to Neural Networks. Having a diverse set of statistical and iterative techniques in your tool belt is essential for any Machine Learning practitioner: even though immensely powerful models are available and widespread today, sometimes a simpler model will do just fine.\n\nIn tandem with how the bias/variance dilemma is fundamental to understanding how to construct good distribution learning models, one should always take into account not to overreach on model complexity given a learning task (Occam's Razor; Rasmussen et al., 2001): use an as simple as possible model, wherever possible.\n\n\nCitations\n\n * Gorman KB, Williams TD, Fraser WR (2014).

It works like so:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import Bucketizer\\nfrom pyspark.sql import DataFrame\\n\\nbucketizer = Bucketizer(\\n    inputCol=\\\"age\\\",\\n    outputCol=\\\"life phase\\\",\\n    splits=[\\n        -float(\\\"inf\\\"), 0, 12, 18, 25, 70, float(\\\"inf\\\")\\n    ]\\n)\\nbucketed: DataFrame = bucketizer.transform(people)\\nbucketed.show()\\n```\\n\\n\\n|age|           name|life phase|\\n|-|-|-|\\n| 12|         Damian|       2.0|\\n| 15|           Jake|       2.0|\\n| 18|        Dominic|       3.0|\\n| 20|           John|       3.0|\\n| 27|          Jerry|       4.0|\\n|101|Jerry's Grandpa|       5.0|\\n\\n\\nCool! We just put our ages in buckets, represented by numbers. Let's now map each bucket to a life phase.\\n\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import lit, create_map\\nfrom typing import Dict\\nfrom pyspark.sql.column import Column\\n\\nrange_mapper = create_map(\\n    [lit(0.0), lit(\\\"Not yet born\\\")]\\n    + [lit(1.0), lit(\\\"Child\\\")]\\n    + [lit(2.0), lit(\\\"Teenager\\\")]\\n    + [lit(3.0), lit(\\\"Young adulthood\\\")]\\n    + [lit(4.0), lit(\\\"Adult\\\")]\\n    + [lit(5.0), lit(\\\"Elderly\\\")]\\n)\\npeople_phase_column: Column = bucketed[\\\"life phase\\\"]\\npeople_with_phase: DataFrame = bucketed.withColumn(\\n    \\\"life phase\\\", range_mapper[people_phase_column]\\n)\\npeople_with_phase.show()\\n\\n```\\n\\n|age|           name|     life phase|\\n|-|-|-|\\n| 12|         Damian|       Teenager|\\n| 15|           Jake|       Teenager|\\n| 18|        Dominic|Young adulthood|\\n| 20|           John|Young adulthood|\\n| 27|          Jerry|          Adult|\\n|101|Jerry's Grandpa|        Elderly|\\n\\n\\n\\n🎉 Success!\\n\\nUsing a combination of `Bucketizer` and `create_map`, we managed to map people's age to their life phases.\\n\\n## `pyspark-bucketmap`\\n\\n🎁 As a bonus, I put all of the above in a neat little module, which you can install simply using `pip`.\\n\\n\\n```python\\n%pip install pyspark-bucketmap\\n```\\n\\nDefine the splits and mappings like before. Each dictionary key is a mapping to the n-th bucket (for example, bucket 1 refers to the range `0` to `12`).\\n\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import List\\n\\nsplits: List[float] = [-float(\\\"inf\\\"), 0, 12, 18, 25, 70, float(\\\"inf\\\")]\\nmapping: Dict[int, Column] = {\\n    0: lit(\\\"Not yet born\\\"),\\n    1: lit(\\\"Child\\\"),\\n    2: lit(\\\"Teenager\\\"),\\n    3: lit(\\\"Young adulthood\\\"),\\n    4: lit(\\\"Adult\\\"),\\n    5: lit(\\\"Elderly\\\"),\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThen, simply import `pyspark_bucketmap.BucketMap` and call `transform()`.\\n\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pyspark_bucketmap import BucketMap\\nfrom typing import List, Dict\\n\\nbucket_mapper = BucketMap(\\n    splits=splits, mapping=mapping, inputCol=\\\"age\\\", outputCol=\\\"phase\\\"\\n)\\nphases_actual: DataFrame = bucket_mapper.transform(people).select(\\\"name\\\", \\\"phase\\\")\\nphases_actual.show()\\n```\\n\\n|           name|          phase|\\n|-|-|\\n|         Damian|       Teenager|\\n|           Jake|       Teenager|\\n|        Dominic|Young adulthood|\\n|           John|Young adulthood|\\n|          Jerry|          Adult|\\n|Jerry's Grandpa|        Elderly|\\n\\n\\nCheers 🙏🏻\\n\\nYou can find the module here:\\n[https://github.com/dunnkers/pyspark-bucketmap](https://github.com/dunnkers/pyspark-bucketmap)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nWritten by [Jeroen Overschie](https://jeroenoverschie.nl/), working at [GoDataDriven](https://godatadriven.com/).\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]],\"ghostVersion\":\"4.0\"}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Have you ever heard of pyspark's <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.Bucketizer.html\"><code>Bucketizer</code></a>?

But a couple of things are still missing. We still want to:</p><ul><li>Install a non-root user for extra safety and good-practice</li><li>Pass in custom VSCode settings and install extensions by default</li><li>Be able to access Spark UI (port 4040)</li><li>Run Continuous Integration (CI) in the Devcontainer</li></ul><p>Let’s see how.</p><h3 id=\"installing-a-non-root-user\"><strong>Installing a non-root user</strong></h3><p>If you <code>pip install</code> a new package, you will see the following message:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/running-pip-as-root.png.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"The warning message: “*WARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager. It is recommended to use a virtual environment instead: [https://pip.pypa.io/warnings/venv](https://pip.pypa.io/warnings/venv)*\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Indeed, it is not recommended to develop as a <em>root</em> user. It is considered a good practice to create a different user with fewer rights to run in production. So let’s go ahead and create a user for this scenario.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Add non-root user\nARG USERNAME=nonroot\nRUN groupadd --gid 1000 $USERNAME &amp;&amp; \n    useradd --uid 1000 --gid 1000 -m $USERNAME\n## Make sure to reflect new user in PATH\nENV PATH=\"/home/${USERNAME}/.local/bin:${PATH}\"\nUSER $USERNAME</code></pre><p>Add the following property to <code>devcontainer.json</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-json\">    \"remoteUser\": \"nonroot\"</code></pre><p>That’s great! When we now start the container we should connect as the user <code>nonroot</code>.</p><h3 id=\"passing-custom-vscode-settings\"><strong>Passing custom VSCode settings</strong></h3><p>Our Devcontainer is still a bit bland, without extensions and settings. Besides any custom extensions a user might want to install, we can install some for them by default already. We can define such settings in <code>customizations.vscode</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-json\">     \"customizations\": {\n        \"vscode\": {\n            \"extensions\": [\n                \"ms-python.python\"\n            ],\n            \"settings\": {\n                \"python.testing.pytestArgs\": [\n                    \".\"\n                ],\n                \"python.testing.unittestEnabled\": false,\n                \"python.testing.pytestEnabled\": true,\n                \"python.formatting.provider\": \"black\",\n                \"python.linting.mypyEnabled\": true,\n                \"python.linting.enabled\": true\n            }\n        }\n    }</code></pre><p>The defined extensions are always installed in the Devcontainer. However, the defined settings provide just a <strong>default</strong> for the user to use, and can still be overridden by other setting scopes like User Settings, Remote Settings, or Workspace Settings.</p><h3 id=\"accessing-spark-ui\"><strong>Accessing Spark UI</strong></h3><p>Since we are using pyspark, we want to be able to access <strong>Spark UI</strong>. When we start a Spark session, VSCode will ask whether you want to forward the specific port. Since we already know this is Spark UI, we can do so automatically:</p><pre><code class=\"language-json\">    \"portsAttributes\": {\n        \"4040\": {\n            \"label\": \"SparkUI\",\n            \"onAutoForward\": \"notify\"\n        }\n    },\n\n    \"forwardPorts\": [\n        4040\n    ]</code></pre><p>When we now run our code, we get a notification we can open Spark UI in the browser:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/application-running-on-port-4040.png.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"open Spark UI in the browser\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Resulting in the Spark UI as we know it:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/spark-ui-visible-in-localhost-4040.png.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"spark UI in the browser\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>✨</p><h3 id=\"running-our-ci-in-the-devcontainer\"><strong>Running our CI in the Devcontainer</strong></h3><p>Wouldn’t it be convenient if we could re-use our Devcontainer to run our Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline as well? Indeed, we can do this with Devcontainers. Similarly to how the Devcontainer image is built locally using <code>docker build</code>, the same can be done <em>within</em> a CI/CD pipeline. There are two basic options:</p><ol><li>Build the Docker image <em>within</em> the CI/CD pipeline</li><li>Prebuilding the image</li></ol><p>To pre-build the image, the build step will need to run either periodically or whenever the Docker definition has changed. Since this adds quite some complexity let’s dive into building the Devcontainer as part of the CI/CD pipeline first (for pre-building the image, see the ‘Awesome resources’ section). We will do so using <strong>GitHub Actions</strong>.</p><h4 id=\"using-devcontainersci\"><strong>Using <code>devcontainers/ci</code></strong></h4><p>Luckily, a GitHub Action was already set up for us to do exactly this:</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/devcontainers/ci\">https://github.com/devcontainers/ci</a></p><p>To now build, push and run a command in the Devcontainer is as easy as:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">name: Python app\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - \"**\"\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout (GitHub)\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Login to GitHub Container Registry\n        uses: docker/login-action@v2\n        with:\n          registry: ghcr.io\n          username: ${{ github.repository_owner }}\n          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n      - name: Build and run dev container task\n        uses: devcontainers/ci@v0.2\n        with:\n          imageName: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}/devcontainer\n          runCmd: pytest .</code></pre><p>That’s great! Whenever this workflow runs on your main branch, the image will be pushed to the configured registry; in this case GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). See below a trace of the executed GitHub Action:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/running-ci-in-the-devcontainer-github-actions.png.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"running-ci-in-the-devcontainer-github-actions\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Awesome!</p><h2 id=\"the-final-devcontainer-definition\"><strong>The final Devcontainer definition</strong></h2><p>We built the following Devcontainer definitions.

The codebase is built on a specific Python version, using a certain Java installation, and an accompanying pyspark version that works with the former. To onboard a new member, you will need to pass a list of instructions the developer needs to follow carefully to get their setup working. But not everyone might run this on the same laptop environment: different hardware, and different operating systems. This is getting challenging.\nBut the setup is a one-off, right? Just go through the setup once and you’ll be good. Not entirely. Your code environment will change over time: your team will probably install-, update- or remove packages during the project’s development. This means that if a developer creates a new feature and changes their own environment to do so; he or she also needs to make sure that the other team members change theirs and that the production environment is updated accordingly. This makes it easy to get misaligned environments: between developers, and between development & production.\n\nWe can do better than this! Instead of giving other developers a setup document, let’s make sure we also create formal instructions so we can automatically set up the development environment. Devcontainers let us do exactly this.\n\nDevcontainers let you connect your IDE to a running Docker container. In this way, we get the benefits of reproducibility and isolation, whilst getting a native development experience.\n\n\n\nDevcontainers can help us:\n\n * Get a reproducible development environment\n * ⚡️ Instantly onboard new team members onto your project\n * ‍ ‍ ‍ Better align the environments between team members\n * ⏱ Keeping your dev environment up-to-date & reproducible saves your team time going into production later\n\nLet’s explore how we can set up a Devcontainer for your Python project!\n\n\nCreating your first Devcontainer\n\nNote that this tutorial is focused on VSCode. Other IDE’s like PyCharm support running in Docker containers but support is less comprehensive than on VSCode.\n\n\nRecap\n\nTo recap, we are trying to create a dev environment that installs: 1) Java, 2) Python and 3) pyspark. And we want to do so automatically, that is, inside a Docker image.\n\n\nProject structure\n\nLet’s say we have a really simple project that looks like this:\n\n$ tree .\n.\n├── README.md\n├── requirements.txt\n├── requirements-dev.txt\n├── sales_analysis.py\n└── test_sales_analysis.py\n\nThat is, we have a Python module with an accompanying test, a requirements.txt file describing our production dependencies (pyspark), and a requirements-dev.txt describing dependencies that should be installed in development only (pytest, black, mypy). Now let’s see how we can extend this setup to include a Devcontainer.\n\n\nThe .devcontainer folder\n\nYour Devcontainer spec will live inside the .devcontainer folder. There will be two main files:\n\n * devcontainer.json\n * Dockerfile\n\nCreate a new file called devcontainer.json:\n\n{\n    \"build\": {\n        \"dockerfile\": \"Dockerfile\",\n        \"context\": \"..\"\n    }\n}\n\nThis means: as a base for our Devcontainer, use the Dockerfile located in the current directory, and build it with a current working directory (cwd) of ...\n\nSo what does this Dockerfile look like?\n\nFROM python:3.10\n\n# Install Java\nRUN apt update && \n    apt install -y sudo && \n    sudo apt install default-jdk -y\n\n## Pip dependencies\n# Upgrade pip\nRUN pip install --upgrade pip\n# Install production dependencies\nCOPY requirements.txt /tmp/requirements.txt\nRUN pip install -r /tmp/requirements.txt && \n    rm /tmp/requirements.txt\n# Install development dependencies\nCOPY requirements-dev.txt /tmp/requirements-dev.txt\nRUN pip install -r /tmp/requirements-dev.txt && \n    rm /tmp/requirements-dev.txt\n\nWe are building our image on top of python:3.10, which is a Debian-based image. This is one of the Linux distributions that a Devcontainer can be built on. The main requirement is that Node.js should be able to run: VSCode automatically installs VSCode Server on the machine. For an extensive list of supported distributions, see “Remote Development with Linux”.\n\nOn top of python:3.10, we install Java and the required pip packages.\n\n\nOpening the Devcontainer\n\nThe .devcontainer folder is in place, so it’s now time to open our Devcontainer.\n\nFirst, make sure you have the Dev Containers extension installed in VSCode (previously called “Remote – Containers”. That done, if you open your repo again, the extension should already detect your Devcontainer:\n\nAlternatively, you can open up the command palette (CMD + Shift + P) and select “Dev Containers: Reopen in Container”:\n\nYour VSCode is now connected to the Docker container :\n\n\nWhat is happening under the hood\n\nBesides starting the Docker image and attaching the terminal to it, VSCode is doing a couple more things:\n\n 1. VSCode Server is being installed on your Devcontainer. VSCode Server is installed as a service in the container itself so your VSCode installation can communicate with the container. For example, install and run extensions.\n 2. Config is copied over. Config like ~/.gitconfig and ~/.ssh/known_hosts are copied over to their respective locations in the container.\n    This then allows you to use your Git repo like you do normally, without re-authenticating.\n 3. Filesystem mounts. VSCode automatically takes care of mounting: 1) The folder you are running the Devcontainer from and 2) your VSCode workspace folder.\n\n\nOpening your repo directly in a Devcontainer\n\nSince all instructions on how to configure your dev environment are now defined in a Dockerfile, users can open up your Devcontainer with just one button:\n\nAin’t that cool? You can add a button to your repo like so:\n\n[\n    ![Open in Remote - Containers](\n        https://xebia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/v1.svg    )\n](\n    https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/godatadriven/python-devcontainer-template\n)\n\nJust modify the GitHub URL ✓.\n\nThat said, we can see having built a Devcontainer can make our README massively more readable. What kind of README would you rather like?\n\nManual installationUsing a Devcontainer\n\n\nExtending the Devcontainer\n\nWe have built a working Devcontainer, which is great! But a couple of things are still missing. We still want to:\n\n * Install a non-root user for extra safety and good-practice\n * Pass in custom VSCode settings and install extensions by default\n * Be able to access Spark UI (port 4040)\n * Run Continuous Integration (CI) in the Devcontainer\n\nLet’s see how.\n\n\nInstalling a non-root user\n\nIf you pip install a new package, you will see the following message:\n\nIndeed, it is not recommended to develop as a root user. It is considered a good practice to create a different user with fewer rights to run in production. So let’s go ahead and create a user for this scenario.\n\n# Add non-root user\nARG USERNAME=nonroot\nRUN groupadd --gid 1000 $USERNAME && \n    useradd --uid 1000 --gid 1000 -m $USERNAME\n## Make sure to reflect new user in PATH\nENV PATH=\"/home/${USERNAME}/.local/bin:${PATH}\"\nUSER $USERNAME\n\nAdd the following property to devcontainer.json:\n\n    \"remoteUser\": \"nonroot\"\n\nThat’s great! When we now start the container we should connect as the user nonroot.\n\n\nPassing custom VSCode settings\n\nOur Devcontainer is still a bit bland, without extensions and settings. Besides any custom extensions a user might want to install, we can install some for them by default already. We can define such settings in customizations.vscode:\n\n     \"customizations\": {\n        \"vscode\": {\n            \"extensions\": [\n                \"ms-python.python\"\n            ],\n            \"settings\": {\n                \"python.testing.pytestArgs\": [\n                    \".\"\n                ],\n                \"python.testing.unittestEnabled\": false,\n                \"python.testing.pytestEnabled\": true,\n                \"python.formatting.provider\": \"black\",\n                \"python.linting.mypyEnabled\": true,\n                \"python.linting.enabled\": true\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nThe defined extensions are always installed in the Devcontainer. However, the defined settings provide just a default for the user to use, and can still be overridden by other setting scopes like User Settings, Remote Settings, or Workspace Settings.\n\n\nAccessing Spark UI\n\nSince we are using pyspark, we want to be able to access Spark UI. When we start a Spark session, VSCode will ask whether you want to forward the specific port. Since we already know this is Spark UI, we can do so automatically:\n\n    \"portsAttributes\": {\n        \"4040\": {\n            \"label\": \"SparkUI\",\n            \"onAutoForward\": \"notify\"\n        }\n    },\n\n    \"forwardPorts\": [\n        4040\n    ]\n\nWhen we now run our code, we get a notification we can open Spark UI in the browser:\n\nResulting in the Spark UI as we know it:\n\n✨\n\n\nRunning our CI in the Devcontainer\n\nWouldn’t it be convenient if we could re-use our Devcontainer to run our Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline as well? Indeed, we can do this with Devcontainers. Similarly to how the Devcontainer image is built locally using docker build, the same can be done within a CI/CD pipeline. There are two basic options:\n\n 1. Build the Docker image within the CI/CD pipeline\n 2. Prebuilding the image\n\nTo pre-build the image, the build step will need to run either periodically or whenever the Docker definition has changed. Since this adds quite some complexity let’s dive into building the Devcontainer as part of the CI/CD pipeline first (for pre-building the image, see the ‘Awesome resources’ section). We will do so using GitHub Actions.\n\nUsing devcontainers/ci\n\nLuckily, a GitHub Action was already set up for us to do exactly this:\n\nhttps://github.com/devcontainers/ci\n\nTo now build, push and run a command in the Devcontainer is as easy as:\n\nname: Python app\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - \"**\"\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout (GitHub)\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Login to GitHub Container Registry\n        uses: docker/login-action@v2\n        with:\n          registry: ghcr.io\n          username: ${{ github.repository_owner }}\n          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n      - name: Build and run dev container task\n        uses: devcontainers/ci@v0.2\n        with:\n          imageName: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}/devcontainer\n          runCmd: pytest .\n\nThat’s great! Whenever this workflow runs on your main branch, the image will be pushed to the configured registry; in this case GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). See below a trace of the executed GitHub Action:\n\nAwesome!\n\n\nThe final Devcontainer definition\n\nWe built the following Devcontainer definitions. First, devcontainer.json:\n\n{\n    \"build\": {\n        \"dockerfile\": \"Dockerfile\",\n        \"context\": \"..\"\n    },\n\n    \"remoteUser\": \"nonroot\",\n\n    \"customizations\": {\n        \"vscode\": {\n            \"extensions\": [\n                \"ms-python.python\"\n            ],\n            \"settings\": {\n                \"python.testing.pytestArgs\": [\n                    \".\"\n                ],\n                \"python.testing.unittestEnabled\": false,\n                \"python.testing.pytestEnabled\": true,\n                \"python.formatting.provider\": \"black\",\n                \"python.linting.mypyEnabled\": true,\n                \"python.linting.enabled\": true\n            }\n        }\n    },\n\n    \"portsAttributes\": {\n        \"4040\": {\n            \"label\": \"SparkUI\",\n            \"onAutoForward\": \"notify\"\n        }\n    },\n\n    \"forwardPorts\": [\n        4040\n    ]\n}\n\nAnd our Dockerfile:\n\nFROM python:3.10\n\n# Install Java\nRUN apt update && \n    apt install -y sudo && \n    sudo apt install default-jdk -y\n\n# Add non-root user\nARG USERNAME=nonroot\nRUN groupadd --gid 1000 $USERNAME && \n    useradd --uid 1000 --gid 1000 -m $USERNAME\n## Make sure to reflect new user in PATH\nENV PATH=\"/home/${USERNAME}/.local/bin:${PATH}\"\nUSER $USERNAME\n\n## Pip dependencies\n# Upgrade pip\nRUN pip install --upgrade pip\n# Install production dependencies\nCOPY --chown=nonroot:1000 requirements.txt /tmp/requirements.txt\nRUN pip install -r /tmp/requirements.txt && \n    rm /tmp/requirements.txt\n# Install development dependencies\nCOPY --chown=nonroot:1000 requirements-dev.txt /tmp/requirements-dev.txt\nRUN pip install -r /tmp/requirements-dev.txt && \n    rm /tmp/requirements-dev.txt\n\nThe full Devcontainer implementation and all the above steps can be found in the various branches of the godatadriven/python-devcontainer-template repo.\n\n\nDocker images architecture: Three environments\n\nWith the CI now set up, we can reuse the same Docker image for two purposes. For local development and running our quality checks. And, once we deploy this application to production, we could configure the Devcontainer to use our production image as a base, and install extra dependencies on top. If we want to optimize the CI image to be as lightweight as possible, we could also strip off any extra dependencies that we do not require in the CI environment; things as extra CLI tooling, a better shell such as ZSH, and so forth.\n\nThis sets us up for having 3 different images for our entire lifecycle. One for Development, one for CI, and finally one for production. This can be visualized like so:\n\nSo, we can see, when using a Devcontainer you can re-use your production image and build on top of it. Install extra tooling, make sure it can talk to VSCode, and you’re done .\n\n\nGoing further\n\nThere are lots of other resources to explore; Devcontainers are well-documented and there are many posts about it. If you’re up for more, let’s see what else you can do.\n\n\nDevcontainer features\n\nDevcontainer features allow you to easily extend your Docker definition with common additions. Some useful features are:\n\n * Common Debian Utilities (Installs ZSH using Oh My ZSH, a non-root user, and useful CLI tools like curl)\n * AWS CLI\n * Azure CLI\n * Git\n * Node.js\n * Python\n * Java\n\n\nDevcontainer templates\n\nOn the official Devcontainer specification website there are loads of templates available.

You meet new people, you learn new things. But have you ever found yourself back in the hotel after a day at a conference, thinking what to do now? Or were you ever stuck in one session, wishing you had gone for that other one? These moments are the perfect opportunity to open up your laptop and compete with your peers in a coding challenge.\n\nAttendees of the three-day conference PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2022 had the possibility to do so, with our coding challenge DropBlox.\n\nParticipants had a bit over one day to submit their solutions. After the deadline, we had received over 100 submissions and rewarded the well-deserved winner a Lego R2D2 in front of a great crowd.\n\nRead on to learn more about this challenge. We will discuss the following:\n\n * What was the challenge exactly, and what trade-offs were made in the design?\n * What was happening behind the screens to make this challenge possible?\n * How did we create hype at the conference itself?\n * What strategies were adopted by the participants to crack the problem?\n\nParticipants used a public repository that we made available here.\n\n\nChallenge\n\nParticipants of the challenge were given the following:\n\n * A 100 x 100 field\n * 1500 blocks of various colors and shapes, each with a unique identifier (see Fig. 1)\n * A rewards table, specifying the points and multipliers per color (see Table 1)\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n\n * Blocks can be dropped in the field from the top at a specified x-coordinate, without changing their rotation (see Fig. 2)\n * Each block can be used at most once\n * The score of a solution is computed using the rewards table. For each row, we add the points of each tile to the score. If the row consists of tiles of a single color only, we multiply the points of that row by the corresponding multiplier. The final score is the sum of the scores of the rows. (see Fig. 3)\n\n\n\nThe solution is a list of block IDs with corresponding x-coordinates. This list specifies which blocks to drop and where, in order to come to the final solution.\nThe goal of the challenge? Getting the most points possible.\n\n\nThe design\n\nWhen designing the challenge, we came up with a few simple requirements to follow:\n\n * The challenge should be easy to get started with\n * The progress and final solution should be easy to visualize\n * It should be difficult to approach the optimum solution\n\nIdeas about N-dimensional versions of this challenge came along, but only the ‘simple’ 2D design ticked all the boxes. It’s easy to visualize, because it’s 2D, and (therefore) easy to get started with. Still, a 100 x 100 field with 1500 blocks allows for enough freedom to play this game in more ways than there are atoms in the universe!\n\n\nBehind the screens\n\nParticipants could, and anyone still can, submit their solutions on the submission page, as well as see the leaderboard with submissions of all other participants. To make this possible, several things happened behind the screens, which are worth noting here.\n\nMost importantly, we worked with a team of excited people with complementing skill sets. Together we created the framework that is visualized in Fig. 4.\n\nWe have a separate private repository, in which we keep all the logic that is hidden to the participant. In there, we have the ground-truth scoring function, and all logic necessary to run our web app. When participants submit their solution or check out the leaderboard, an Azure Function spins up to run the logic of our web app. The Azure Function is connected to an SQL database, where we store or retrieve submissions from.  We store images, such as the visualization of the final solution, in the blob storage. To create the leaderboard, we retrieve the top-scoring submissions of each user and combine them with the corresponding images in the blob storage.\n\n\nCreating hype\n\nWhat’s the use of a competition if nobody knows about it? Spread the word!\n\nTo attract attention to our coding competition, we did two things. First, we set up an appealing booth at the company stands. We put our prize right in front, and a real-time dashboard showing the highscores beside. Surely, anyone walking past will at least question themselves what that Lego toy is doing at a Python conference.\n\nSecond, we went out to the conference Lightning Talks and announced our competition there. Really, the audience was great. Gotta love the energy at conferences like these.\n\nWith our promotion set up, competitors started trickling in. Let the games begin!\n\n\nStrategies\n\nStrategies varied from near brute-force approaches to the use of convolutional kernels and clever heuristics. In the following, we discuss some interesting and top-scoring submissions of participants.\n\n#14\n\nS. Tschöke named his first approach “Breakfast cereal”, as he was inspired by smaller cereal pieces collecting at the bottom and larger ones in the top of a cereal bag. Pieces were dropped from left to right, smaller ones before larger ones, until none could fit anymore. This approach, resulting in around 25k points, was however not successful enough.\n\nAfter a less successful, but brave approach using a genetic algorithm, he extended the breakfast cereal approach. This time, instead of the size of a block he used the block’s density, or the percentage of filled tiles within the height and width of a block; and he sorted the blocks by color. Taking a similar approach as before, but now including the different color orderings, resulted in 46k points. (See Fig. 6)\n\n#2\n\nWe jump up a few places to R. Garnier, who was #1 up until the last moments of the challenge. He went along with a small group of dedicated participants who started exploiting the row multipliers. Unexpectedly, this led to an interesting and exciting development in the competition.\n\nHis strategy consisted of two parts. The first is to manually construct some rows of the same color of the same height. This way, he created 3 full orange rows, one red and one purple. Subsequently, he uses a greedy algorithm, following the steps:\n\n 1. Assign a score to each block: score = (block values) / (block surface)\n 2. Sort the blocks by score\n 3. For each block, drop the block where it falls down the furthest\n\nThis strategy resulted in 62k points. (See Fig. 7)\n\n\n#1\n\nWith a single last-minute submission, G. Chanturia answered the question to “How far can we go?”. He carefully constructed pairs of blocks that fit together, to manually engineer the bottom half of his solution, taking the row multipliers to the next level.\n\nG. is doing a PhD in Physics and a MSc in Computer Science, and fittingly splits his solution into a “physicist’s solution” and a “programmer’s solution”.\n\nThe physicist’s solution refers to the bottom part of the field. The strategy used here, as summarized by G., was (1) taking a look at the blocks, and (2) placing them in a smart way. Whether you are a theoretical or experimental physicist, data serves as a starting point. G. noticed there is an order in the blocks. First of all, a lot of orange blocks had their top and bottom rows filled. Placing these in a clever way already results in six completely filled rows.\nSecond, there were “W” and “M”-shaped blocks that fit perfectly together. He kept going on like this to manually construct the bottom 1/3 of the field, accounting for 57% of the total score.\n\nThe programmer’s solution refers to the rest of the field. The problem with the first approach is that it is not scalable. Even more, if the blocks would change he would have to start all over. This second approach is more robust, and is similar to R. Garnier’s approach. The steps are:\n\n 1. Filter blocks based on their height. Blocks above height = 5 are filtered out, because many of these blocks have too weird shapes to work with.\n 2. Sort the blocks by points (or similarly, by color). Blocks with higher scoring colors are listed first.\n 3. Pick the first n available blocks in the sorted list. The larger n, the better the solution, but the longer it takes to run. The chosen number was around 50.\n 4. Find out which block can fall the furthest down in the field\n 5. Drop that block and remove it from the list\n 6. Repeat from 3\n\nAnd most importantly, the #1 place does not go home empty-handed. The #1 contender wins the infamous Lego R2D2! And we can acknowledge that indeed, yes, the R2D2 turned quite some heads at the conference. The award was given to the winner at the last Lightning Talk series of the conference.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nOrganising the coding challenge has been lots of fun. We created a framework to host a high score leaderboard, process submissions and display the puzzles online.

This is often the case when releasing a package, for example. How can we easily automate running our Code Quality pipeline using our pipeline <em>templates</em>? One option is to manually define a couple jobs and install the correct python version in each job. Another option is to use a <strong><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema/jobs-job-strategy?view=azure-pipelines\">strategy matrix</a></strong>.

Most often, they are configured on a per project basis. This works fine when you have few projects. But what if you have many projects? In this blog post, we will show you how you can scale up your Azure DevOps CI/CD setup for reusability and easy maintenance.\n\n\nYour typical DevOps pipeline\n\nA typical DevOps pipeline is placed inside the project repository. Let’s consider a pipeline for a Python project. It includes the following steps:\n\n * quality checks such as code formatting and linting\n * building a package such as a Python wheel\n * releasing a package to Python package registry (such as Azure Artifacts or PyPi)\n\nUsing an Azure DevOps pipeline, we can achieve this like so:\n\ntrigger:\n- main\n\nsteps:\n# Python setup & dependencies\n- task: UsePythonVersion@0\n  inputs:\n    versionSpec: 3.10\n\n- script: |\n    pip install .[dev,build,release]\n  displayName: 'Install dependencies'\n\n# Code Quality\n- script: |\n    black --check .\n  displayName: 'Formatting'\n\n- script: |\n    flake8 .\n  displayName: 'Linting'\n\n- script: |\n    pytest .\n  displayName: 'Testing'\n\n# Build\n- script: |\n    echo $(Build.BuildNumber) > version.txt\n  displayName: 'Set version number'\n\n- script: |\n    pip wheel \\\n      --no-deps \\\n      --wheel-dir dist/ \\\n      .\n  displayName: 'Build wheel'\n\n# Publish\n- task: TwineAuthenticate@1\n  inputs:\n    artifactFeed: 'better-devops-pipelines-blogpost/devops-pipelines-blogpost'\n  displayName: 'Authenticate pip with twine'\n\n- script: |\n    twine upload \\\n      --config-file $(PYPIRC_PATH) \\\n      --repository devops-pipelines-blogpost \\\n      dist/*.whl\n  displayName: 'Publish wheel with twine'\n\n\nWell, that is great, right? We have achieved all the goals we desired:\n\n * Code quality checks using black, flake8 and pytest.\n * Build and package the project as a Python wheel.\n * Publish the package to a registry of choice, in this case Azure Artifacts.\n\n\nGrowing pains\n\nA DevOps pipeline like the above works fine for a single project. But, … what if we want to scale up? Say our company grows, we create more repositories and more projects need to be packaged and released. Will we simply copy this pipeline and paste it into a new repository? Given that we are growing in size, can we be more efficient than just running this pipeline from start to finish?\n\nThe answer is no – we do not have to copy/paste all these pipelines into a new repo, and the answer is yes – we can be more efficient in running these pipelines. Let’s see how.\n\n\nScaling up properly\n\nLet’s see how we can create scalable DevOps pipelines. First, we are going to introduce DevOps pipeline templates. These are modular pieces of pipeline that we can reuse across various pipelines and also across various projects residing in different repositories.\n\nLet’s see how we can use pipeline templates to our advantage.\n\n\n1. DevOps template setup\n\nLet’s rewrite pieces of our pipeline into DevOps pipeline templates. Important to know here is that you can write templates for either stages, jobs or steps. The hierarchy is as follows:\n\nstages:\n- stage: Stage1\n  jobs:\n  - job: Job1\n    steps:\n    - step: Step1\n\n\nThis can be illustrated in an image like so:\n\nWe can then create a template in one file, for example for steps:\n\ntemplates/code-quality.yml\n\nsteps:\n- script: |\n    echo \"Hello world!\"\n\n\n.. and reuse it in our former pipeline:\n\nstages:\n- stage: Stage1\n  jobs:\n  - job: Job1\n    steps:\n    - template: templates/code-quality.yml\n\n\n… or for those who prefer a more visual way of displaying it:\n\nThat’s how easy it is to use DevOps pipeline templates! Let’s now apply it to our own usecase.\n\nCode quality checks template\n\nFirst, let’s put the code quality checks pipeline into a template. We are also making the pipeline more extensive so it outputs test results and coverage reports. Remember, we are only defining this template once and then reusing it in other places.\n\ntemplates/code-quality.yml\n\nsteps:\n# Code Quality\n- script: |\n    black --check .\n  displayName: 'Formatting'\n\n- script: |\n    flake8 .\n  displayName: 'Linting'\n\n- script: |\n    pytest \\\n      --junitxml=junit/test-results.xml \\\n      --cov=. \\\n      --cov-report=xml:coverage.xml \\\n      .\n  displayName: 'Testing'\n\n# Publish test results + coverage\n- task: PublishTestResults@2\n  condition: succeededOrFailed()\n  inputs:\n    testResultsFiles: '**/test-*.xml'\n    testRunTitle: 'Publish test results'\n    failTaskOnFailedTests: true\n  displayName: 'Publish test results'\n\n- task: PublishCodeCoverageResults@1\n  inputs:\n    codeCoverageTool: 'Cobertura'\n    summaryFileLocation: '**/coverage.xml'\n  displayName: 'Publish test coverage'\n\n\n… which we are using like so:\n\nsteps:\n- template: templates/code-quality.yml\n\n\nEasy! Also note we included two additional tasks: one to publish the test results and another to publish code coverage reports. That information is super useful to display inside DevOps. Lucky for us, DevOps has support for that:\n\n… clicking on the test results brings us to the Tests view, where we can exactly which test failed (if any failed):\n\nLastly, there’s also a view explaining which lines of code you covered with tests and which you did not:\n\nThose come in very useful when you are working on testing your code!\n\nNow, we have defined this all in DevOps templates. That gives us a more comfortable position to define more elaborate pipeline steps because we will import those templates instead of copy/pasting them.\n\nThat said, we can summarise the benefits of using DevOps templates like so:\n\n * Define once, reuse everywhere\n   We can reuse this code quality checks pipeline in both the same project multiple times but also from other repositories. If you are importing from another repo, see ‘Use other repositories‘ for setup.\n * Make it failproof\n   You can invest into making just this template very good; instead of having multiple bad versions hanging around in your organisation.\n * Reduce complexity\n   Abstracting away commonly used code can be efficient for the readability of your pipeline. This allows newcomers to easily understand the different parts of your CI/CD setup using DevOps pipelines.\n\n\n2. Passing data between templates\n\nLet’s go a step further and also abstract away the build and release steps into templates. We are going to use the following template for building a Python wheel:\n\nsteps:\n# Build wheel\n- script: |\n    echo $(Build.BuildNumber) > version.txt\n  displayName: 'Set version number'\n\n- script: |\n    pip wheel \\\n      --no-deps \\\n      --wheel-dir dist/ \\\n      .\n  displayName: 'Build wheel'\n\n# Upload wheel as artifact\n- task: CopyFiles@2\n  inputs:\n    contents: dist/**\n    targetFolder: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)\n  displayName: 'Copy wheel to artifacts directory'\n\n- publish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/dist'\n  artifact: wheelFiles\n  displayName: 'Upload wheel as artifact'\n\n\nThis definition is slightly different than the one we defined before, in the initial pipeline. This pipeline uses artifacts. These allow us to pass data between jobs or stages. This is useful when we want to split up our pipeline into smaller pieces. Splitting up the process into smaller segments gives us more visibility and control over the process. Another benefit of this, is that when we split the Python wheel build and release process, is that we give ourselves the ability to release to multiple providers at once.\n\nWhen this pipeline is ran we can see an artifact (a wheel file) has been added:\n\n… with the actual wheel file in there:\n\nThis is also useful so we can inspect what the build pipeline has produced. We can now download this wheel file from the artifacts again. We will do this in the publish pipeline.\n\ntemplate/publish-wheel.yml\n\nparameters:\n- name: artifactFeed\n  type: string\n- name: repositoryName\n  type: string\n\nsteps:\n# Retrieve wheel\n- download: current\n  artifact: wheelFiles\n  displayName: 'Download artifacts'\n\n# Publish wheel\n- task: TwineAuthenticate@1\n  inputs:\n    artifactFeed: ${{ parameters.artifactFeed }}\n  displayName: 'Authenticate pip with twine'\n\n- script: |\n    twine upload \\\n      --config-file $(PYPIRC_PATH) \\\n      --repository ${{ parameters.repositoryName }} \\\n      $(Pipeline.Workspace)/wheelFiles/*.whl\n  displayName: 'Publish wheel with twine'\n\n\n… both the build- and release pipeline can be used like so:\n\n- stage: Build\n  jobs:\n  - job: BuildWheel\n    steps:\n    - task: UsePythonVersion@0\n      inputs:\n        versionSpec: 3.10\n\n    - script: |\n        pip install .[build]\n      displayName: 'Install dependencies'\n\n    - template: templates/build-wheel.yml\n\n\n- stage: Publish\n  jobs:\n  - job: PublishWheel\n    steps:\n    - script: |\n        pip install twine==4.0.2\n      displayName: 'Install twine'\n\n    - template: templates/publish-wheel.yml\n      parameters:\n        artifactFeed: 'better-devops-pipelines-blogpost/devops-pipelines-blogpost'\n        repositoryName: 'devops-pipelines-blogpost'\n\n\nAnd here we have another new feature coming in. Stages. These allow us to execute pipelines that depend on each other. We have now split up our pipeline into 2 stages:\n\n 1. Build stage\n 2. Publish stage\n\nUsing stages makes it easy to see what is going on. It provides transparency and allows you to easily track the progress of the pipeline. You can also launch stages separately, skipping previous stages, as long as the necessary dependencies are in place. For example, dependencies can include artifacts, which were generated in previous stage.\n\nImproving the release process\n\nSo what is another advantage of this setup? Say that you are releasing your package to two pip registries. Doing that is easy using this setup by creating two jobs in the publish stage:\n\n- stage: Publish\n  jobs:\n  - job: PublishToRegistryOne\n    steps:\n    - script: |\n        pip install twine==4.0.2\n      displayName: 'Install twine'\n\n    - template: templates/publish-wheel.yml\n      parameters:\n        artifactFeed: 'better-devops-pipelines-blogpost/registry-1'\n        repositoryName: 'devops-pipelines-blogpost'\n\n  - job: PublishToRegistryTwo\n    steps:\n    - script: |\n        pip install twine==4.0.2\n      displayName: 'Install twine'\n\n    - template: templates/publish-wheel.yml\n      parameters:\n        artifactFeed: 'better-devops-pipelines-blogpost/registry-2'\n        repositoryName: 'devops-pipelines-blogpost'\n\n\nAs you can see, we can use the defined templates to scale our pipelines. What is essential here, is that thanks to using the artifacts, we can build our wheel once and consume that same wheel multiple times.\n\nAdditionally, the publishing jobs launch in parallel by default (unless dependencies are explicitly defined). This speeds up your release process.\n\n\n3. Automate using a strategy matrix\n\nLet’s go back to the code quality stage for a minute. In the code quality stage, we are first installing a certain Python version, and then running all quality checks. However, we might need guarantees that our code works for multiple Python versions. This is often the case when releasing a package, for example. How can we easily automate running our Code Quality pipeline using our pipeline templates? One option is to manually define a couple jobs and install the correct python version in each job. Another option is to use a strategy matrix. This allows us to define a matrix of variables that we can use in our pipeline.\n\nWe can improve our CodeQualityChecks job like so:\n\njobs:\n- job: CodeQualityChecks\n  strategy:\n    matrix:\n      Python38:\n        python.version: '3.8'\n      Python39:\n        python.version: '3.9'\n      Python310:\n        python.version: '3.10'\n      Python311:\n        python.version: '3.11'\n\n  steps:\n  - task: UsePythonVersion@0\n    inputs:\n      versionSpec: $(python.version)\n\n  - script: |\n      pip install .[dev]\n    displayName: 'Install dependencies'\n\n  - template: templates/code-quality.yml\n\n\nAwesome! The pipeline now runs the entire code quality pipeline for each Python version. Looking at how our pipeline runs now, we can see multiple jobs, one for each Python version:\n\n.. as you can see 4 jobs are launched. If no job dependencies are explicitly set, jobs within one stage run in parallel! That greatly speed up the pipeline and lets you iterate faster! That’s definitely a win.\n\n\nFinal result\n\nLet’s wrap it up! Our entire pipeline, using templates:\n\ntrigger:\n- main\n\nstages:\n- stage: CodeQuality\n  jobs:\n  - job: CodeQualityChecks\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        Python38:\n          python.version: '3.8'\n        Python39:\n          python.version: '3.9'\n        Python310:\n          python.version: '3.10'\n        Python311:\n          python.version: '3.11'\n\n    steps:\n    - task: UsePythonVersion@0\n      inputs:\n        versionSpec: $(python.version)\n\n    - script: |\n        pip install .[dev]\n      displayName: 'Install dependencies'\n\n    - template: templates/code-quality.yml\n\n\n- stage: Build\n  jobs:\n  - job: BuildWheel\n    steps:\n    - task: UsePythonVersion@0\n      inputs:\n        versionSpec: 3.10\n\n    - script: |\n        pip install .[build]\n      displayName: 'Install dependencies'\n\n    - template: templates/build-wheel.yml\n\n\n- stage: Publish\n  jobs:\n  - job: PublishWheel\n    steps:\n    - script: |\n        pip install twine==4.0.2\n      displayName: 'Install twine'\n\n    - template: templates/publish-wheel.yml\n      parameters:\n        artifactFeed: 'better-devops-pipelines-blogpost/devops-pipelines-blogpost'\n        repositoryName: 'devops-pipelines-blogpost'\n\n\n… which uses these templates:\n\n * templates/code-quality.yml\n * templates/build-wheel.yml\n * templates/publish-wheel.yml\n\n… for the entire source code see the better-devops-pipelines-blogpost repo. The repository contains pipelines that apply above explained principles. The pipelines provide testing, building and releasing for a Python project ✓.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nWe demonstrated how to scale up your Azure DevOps CI/CD setup making it reusable, maintainable and modular. This helps you maintain a good CI/CD setup as your company grows.\n\nIn short, we achieved the following:\n\n * Create modular DevOps pipelines using templates. This makes it more easy to reuse pipelines across projects and repositories\n * Pass data between DevOps pipeline jobs using artifacts.

Services like Vertex AI Search & Conversation and Vertex AI Vector Search give us scalability and ease of use. How can you best leverage them to build RAG applications? Let’s explore together. Read along!\n\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation\n\nEven though Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was coined already in 2020, the technique got supercharged since the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). With RAG, LLMs are combined with search techniques like vector search to enable realtime and efficient lookup of information that is outside the model’s knowledge. This opens up many exciting new possibilities. Whereas previously interactions with LLMs were limited to the model’s knowledge, with RAG it is now possible to load in company internal data like knowledge bases. Additionally, by instructing the LLM to always ‘ground’ its answer based on factual data, hallucinations can be reduced.\n\n\nWhy RAG?\n\nLet’s first take a step back. How exactly can RAG benefit us? When we interact with an LLM, all its factual knowledge is stored inside the model weights. The model weights are set during its training phase, which can be a while ago. In fact, this can be more than a year.\n\nLLMKnowledge cut-offGemini 1.0 ProEarly 2023 [1]GPT-3.5 turboSeptember 2021 [2]GPT-4September 2021 [3]\n\nKnowledge cut-offs as of March 2024.\n\nAdditionally, these publically offered models are trained on mostly public data. If you want to use company internal data, an option is to fine-tune or retrain the model, which can be expensive and time-consuming.\n\nThis boils down to three main limitations: the models knowledge is outdated, the model has no access to internal data, and the model can hallucinate answers.\n\nWith RAG we can circumvent these limitations. Given the question a user has, information relevant to that question can be retrieved first to then be presented to the LLM.\n\nThe LLM can then augment its answer with the retrieved information to generate a factual, up-to-date and yet human-readable answer. The LLM is to be instructed to at all times ground its answer in the retrieved information, which can help reduce hallucinations.\n\nThese benefits are great. So how do we actually build a RAG system?\n\n\nBuilding a RAG system\n\nIn a RAG system, there are two main steps: 1) Document retrieval and 2) Answer generation. Whereas the document retrieval is responsible for finding the most relevant information given the user’s question, the answer generation is responsible for generating a human-readable answer based on information found in the retrieval step. Let’s take a look at both in more detail.\n\n\nDocument retrieval\n\nFirst, Document retrieval. Documents are converted to plain text and chunked. The chunks are then embedded and stored in a vector database. User questions are also embedded, enabling a vector similarity search to obtain the best matching documents. Optionally, a step can be added to extract document metadata like title, author, summary, keywords, etc, which can subsequently be used to perform a keyword search. This can all be illustrated like so:\n\nNeat. But what about GCP. We can map the former to GCP as follows:\n\nDocument AI is used to process documents and extract text, Gemini and textembedding-gecko to generate metadata and embeddings respectively and Vertex AI Vector Search is used to store the embeddings and perform similarity search. By using these services, we can build a scalable retrieval step.\n\n\nAnswer generation\n\nThen, Answer generation. We will need an LLM for this and instruct it to use the provided documents. We can illustrate this like so:\n\nHere, the documents can be formatted using an arbitrary function that generates valid markdown.\n\nWe have already come across multiple GCP services that can help us build a RAG system. So now, what other offerings does GCP have to help us build a RAG system and what flavours are there to combine services?\n\n\nThe RAG flavours on GCP\n\nSo far, we have seen GCP services that can help us build a RAG system. These include Document AI, Vertex AI Vector Search, Gemini Pro, Cloud Storage and Cloud Run. But GCP also has Vertex AI Search & Conversation.\n\nVertex AI Search & Conversation is a service tailored to GenAI usecases, built to do some of the heavy lifting for us. It can ingest documents, create embeddings and manage the vector database. You just have to focus on ingesting data in the correct format. Then, you can use Search & Conversation in multiple ways. You can either get only search results, given a search query, or you can let Search & Conversation generate a full answer for you with source citations.\n\nEven though Vertex AI Search & Conversation is very powerful, there can be scenarios when you want more control. Let’s take a look on these levels of going either managed or remaining in-control.\n\nThe easiest way to get started with RAG on GCP is to use Search & Conversation. The service can ingest documents from multiple sources like Big Query and Google Cloud Storage. Once those are ingested, it can generate answers backed by citations for you. This is simply illustrated like so:\n\nIf you want more control, you can use Gemini for answer generation instead of letting Search & Conversation do it for us. This way, you can have more control to do any prompt engineering you like.\n\nLastly, you can have full control over the RAG system. This means you have to manage both the document retrieval and answer generation yourself. This does mean more manual work in engineering the system. Documents can be processed by Document AI, chunked, embedded and its vectors stored in Vertex AI Vector Search. Then Gemini can be used to generate the final answers.\n\nThe advantage here is that you are able to fully control yourself how you process the documents an convert them to embeddings. You can use all of Document AI’s Processors offering to process the documents in different ways.\n\nDo take the the managed versus manual approach tradeoffs into consideration. Ask yourself questions like:\n\n * How much time and energy do you want to invest building something custom for the flexibility that you need?\n * Do you really need the flexibility for your solution to give in to extra maintenance cost?\n * Do you have the engineering capacity to build- and maintain a custom solution?\n * Are the initially invested build costs worth the money saved in not using a managed solution?\n\nSo then, you can decide what works best for you ✓.\n\n\nConcluding\n\nRAG is a powerful way to augment LLMs with external data. This can help reduce hallucinations and provide more factual answers. At the core of RAG systems are document processors, vector databases and LLM’s.\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform offers services that can help build production-ready RAG solutions. We have described three levels of control in deploying a RAG application on GCP:\n\n * Fully managed: using Search & Conversation.\n * Partly managed: managed search using Search & Conversation but manual prompt-engineering using Gemini.\n * Full control: manual document processing using Document AI, embedding creation and vector database management using Vertex AI Vector Search.\n\nThat said, I wish you good luck implementing your own RAG system.
